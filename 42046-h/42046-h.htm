<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">&#8216;Irish policy,&#8217;</span> said Mr. Disraeli in the House of Commons,
&#8216;is Irish history, and I have no faith in any statesman, who
attempts to remedy the evils of Ireland, who is either
ignorant of the past or who will not take lessons from it.&#8217;
This is most true, and history, if it is to be of any use, should
be written for instruction, and not merely for the confirmation
of existing prejudices. This is especially so in the
present case, for, as Sir George Stanley told Cecil in 1565,
&#8216;the practises of Ireland be great, and not understood to all
men that seem to have knowledge thereof.&#8217; The writer who
enters the arena as an advocate may produce an interesting
party pamphlet, but he will hardly make the world either
wiser or better. The historian&#8217;s true office is that of the judge,
whose duty it is to marshal all the material facts with just so
much of comment as may enable his hearers to give them
their due weight. The reading public is the jury.</p>

<p>Starting with this conception of the task before me, I
have not attempted to please any party or school. The
history of Ireland is at the best a sad one; but its study, if
it be really studied for the truth&#8217;s sake, can hardly fail to
make men more tolerant. In Ireland, as in other countries,
a purely Celtic population was unable to resist the impact
of the Teutonic race. First came the pagan Northmen, with
power to ruin, but without power to reconstruct. Then
followed the Anglo-Normans, seeking for lands and lordships,
but seeking them under the patronage of the Catholic Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
For a time it seemed as though the conquest would be
complete; but the colony proved too weak for its work, and
the mail-clad knights failed almost as completely as the
Scandinavian corsairs.</p>

<p>The main cause of this second failure was the neglect
or jealousy of the kings. They feared the growth of an
independent power within sight of the English shore, and
they had neither means nor inclination to do the work of
government themselves. Little gain and less glory were to
be had in Ireland, and Scotch, Welsh, or Continental politics
engrossed their attention in turn. They weakened the colony,
partly of set purpose, and partly by drawing men and supplies
from thence. In short, they were absentees; and, to use
an expression which has gained currency in modern times,
they were generally content to look upon Ireland as a mere
drawfarm.</p>

<p>The Wars of the Roses almost completed the ruin of the
work which Henry II. had begun. For a moment it seemed
as if the colony was about to assert its independence. But
this could not have been done without an understanding with
the native race, and it does not appear that any such
understanding was possible. The upshot was that Yorkist
and Lancastrian parties were formed in Ireland, that the
colony was thus still further weakened, and that the English
language and power seemed on the point of disappearing
altogether.</p>

<p>The throne of Henry VIII. was erected on the ruins of
mediæval feudalism, and guarded by a nation which longed
for rest, and which saw no hope but in a strong monarchy.
The King saw that he had duties in Ireland. Utterly
unscrupulous where his own passions were concerned, the
idea of a patriot King was not altogether strange to him.
Irish chiefs were encouraged to visit his court, and were
allowed to bask in the sunshine of royal favour; and it is
conceivable that the &#8216;Defender of the Faith,&#8217; had he con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>tinued
to defend it in the original sense, might have ended by
attaching the native Irish to the Crown. By respecting for
a time their tribal laws, by making one chief an earl and
another a knight, by mediating in their quarrels, and by
attending to their physical and spiritual wants, a Catholic
Tudor might possibly have succeeded where Anglican and
Plantagenet had failed. The revolution in religion changed
everything, and out of it grew what many regard as the insoluble
Irish question.</p>

<p>Henry II. had found Ireland in the hands of a Celtic
people, for the intermixture of Scandinavian blood was slight
and partial. Henry VIII. found it inhabited by a mixed
race. From the beginning there had been rivalry and ill-feeling
between men of English blood born in Ireland, and
those of English birth who were sent over as officials or who
went over as adventurers. During the fifteenth century
England did nothing to preserve the ties of kinship, and the
Celtic reaction tended to swallow up the interlopers. The
degenerate English proverbially became more Irish than the
Irish themselves, but the distinction would scarcely have
been so nearly obliterated had it not been for the change in
religion. The nobles of the Pale, the burghers of the walled
towns, and the lawyers in Dublin were equally disinclined to
accept the new model. Neither Irish chieftains nor Anglo-Irish
lords found much difficulty in acknowledging Henry&#8217;s
supremacy both in Church and State; but further than that
they would not go. The people did not go so far, and, in the
words of the annalists, regarded the Reformation simply as a
&#8216;heresy and new error.&#8217;</p>

<p>Religion itself was at an extremely low ebb, and only the
friars preserved the memory of better days. Henry may
have imagined that he could lead the people through the
bishops and other dignitaries: if so, he was entirely mistaken.
The friars defied his power, and the hearts of the poor were
with them. In Ireland, at least, it was Rome that under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>took
the work of popular reformation. The Franciscans and
Jesuits endured cold and hunger, bonds and death, while
courtly prelates neglected their duties or were distinguished
from lay magnates only by the more systematic nature of
their oppressions. And thus, as the hatred of England daily
deepened, the attachment of the Irish to Rome became daily
closer. Every effort of Henry to conciliate them was frustrated
by their spiritual guides, who urged with perfect truth
that he was an adulterer, a tyrant, and a man of blood.
Holding such cards as these, the friars could hardly lose the
game, and they had little difficulty in proving to willing ears
that the King&#8217;s ancestors received Ireland from the Pope, and
that his apostasy had placed him in the position of a defaulting
vassal.</p>

<p>Henry&#8217;s vacillations and the early deaths of Edward and
Mary for a time obscured the true nature of the contest, but
it became apparent in Elizabeth&#8217;s time. She was an excommunicated
Queen. From a Catholic point of view she was
clearly illegitimate. Many English Catholics ignored all this
and served her well and truly, but those who carried dogmas
to their logical conclusions flocked to the enemy&#8217;s camp.
Spain, Belgium, and Italy were filled with English refugees,
who were willing enough that the Queen should be hurt in
Ireland, since England was beyond their reach. But even
here national antipathies were visible, and Irish suitors for
Spanish help came constantly into collision with Englishmen
bent upon the same errand.</p>

<p>Desmond, Shane O&#8217;Neill, and Hugh O&#8217;Neill seem to have
cared very little for religion themselves. The first was a
tool of Rome; the two latter rather made the Church subservient
to their own ambition. But in these cases, and in a
hundred others of less importance, the religious feeling of the
people was always steadily opposed to the English Crown.
Elizabeth was by nature no persecutor, yet she persecuted.
Her advisers always maintained, and her apologists may still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
maintain, that in hanging a Campion or torturing an
O&#8217;Hurley she did not meddle with freedom of conscience,
but only punished those who were plotting against her
crown. The Catholics, on the other hand, could plead that
they had done nothing worthy of death or of bonds, nor
against lawful authority, and that they suffered for conscience&#8217;
sake. And the Continental nations, who were mainly Catholic,
sided on the whole with the refugees. Ireland, it is true,
was only a pawn in their game, and Philip II. was probably
wrong in not making her much more. At Cork or Galway
the Armada might have met with scarcely any resistance, and
a successful descent would have taxed Elizabeth&#8217;s resources
to the utmost.</p>

<p>The poverty of the Crown is the key to many problems
of the Elizabethan age. The Queen had to keep Scotland
quiet, to hold Spain at bay, and to maintain tolerable relations
with France. She saw what ought to be done in
Ireland, but very often could not afford to do it. The tendency
to temporise was perhaps constitutional, but it was
certainly much increased by want of money. Her vacillating
policy did much harm, but it was caused less by changes of
opinion than by circumstances. When the pressure at other
points slackened she could attend to her troublesome kingdom;
when it increased she was often forced to postpone her
Irish plans. Ireland has always suffered, and still suffers
sorely, from want of firmness. In modern times party exigencies
work mischief analogous to that formerly caused by
the sovereign&#8217;s necessities.</p>

<p>The dissolution of the monasteries was followed by no
proper provision for education. In the total absence of
universities and grammar-schools, certain monks and nuns
had striven nobly to keep the lamp of knowledge burning,
but they were ruthlessly driven from house and home.
Elizabeth was alive to all this, but she could not give Ireland
her undivided attention, and such remedies as were applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
came too late. The oppressed friars kept possession of the
popular ear, and the Jesuits found the crop ready for their
sickle. Denied education at home, many sons of good
families sought it abroad, and the natural leaders of the Irish
acquired habits of thought very different from those of
English gentlemen. Archbishop Fitzgibbon, one of the
most important champions of Catholic Ireland, saw clearly
that his country could not stand alone. He would have
preferred the sovereignty of England, but she had become
aggressively Protestant, and he turned to Spain, to France,
to Rome, anywhere rather than to the land whence his own
ancestors had sprung. The lineage of the United Irishmen
and their numerous progeny may be easily traced back to
Tudor times.</p>

<p>A few words now to the critics whom every writer hopes
to have. The spelling both of Irish names and English
documents has throughout been modernised, from regard to
the feelings of the public. Irish history is already sufficiently
repulsive to that great unknown quantity the general reader,
and it would be cruel to add to its horrors. Etymologists
will always go for their materials to originals, and not to
modern compositions. When, therefore, such names as
Clandeboye or Roderic O&#8217;Connor are met with in the text,
it is not to be supposed that I have never heard of Clann-Aedha-Buidhe
or Ruaidhri O&#8217;Conchobair.</p>

<p>Of the first 123 pages of this book, I need only say that
original authorities have as much as possible been consulted.
In the third and four following chapters, much use has been
made of Mr. Gilbert&#8217;s &#8216;Viceroys,&#8217; a debt which I desire to
acknowledge once for all. In so succinct a review of more
than three centuries, it has not been thought necessary to
quote the authority for every fact.</p>

<p>For the reign of Henry VIII. I have chiefly relied on the
second and third volumes of the &#8216;State Papers,&#8217; published in
1834. They are sometimes cited as &#8216;S. P.&#8217; or &#8216;State Papers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>&#8217;
and when only the date of a letter or report is given it must
be understood that this collection is referred to. The great
calendar of letters and papers begun by Dr. Brewer and
continued by Mr. Gairdner contains some items not included
in the older publication; it is referred to as <cite>Brewer</cite>. Other
sources of information have not been neglected, and are
indicated in the footnotes.</p>

<p>The account of the reigns of Edward VI., Mary, and
Elizabeth is chiefly drawn from the &#8216;State Papers, <cite>Ireland</cite>&#8217;&mdash;all
documents preserved in the Public Record Office and
calendared by Mr. Hans Claude Hamilton. How excellently
the editor has done his work can only be appreciated by one
who has entered into his labours as closely as I have done.
Except where a document has already been printed, I have
nearly always referred to the original MS. All documents
cited by date or number without further description must be
understood as being in this collection. The late Dr. Brewer&#8217;s
calendar of the Carew MSS. at Lambeth often fills up gaps
in the greater series; it is referred to as <cite>Carew</cite>. Many
papers, both in Fetter Lane and at Lambeth, are copies; but
their authenticity is not disputed. The Carew calendar is on
so full a plan that it has not been thought necessary to
consult the manuscripts; indeed, except for local purposes,
it is not likely that they will be much consulted in the
future. Other collections are referred to in their places, but
it may be well to mention specially the journal of the Irish
(Kilkenny) Archæological Society, whose editor, the Rev.
James Graves, has done as much as any man to lay a broad
foundation for Irish history.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Donovan&#8217;s splendid edition of the &#8216;Four Masters&#8217; has
generally been consulted for the Irish version of every important
fact. O&#8217;Clery and his fellow-compilers wrote under
Charles I., and are not therefore strictly contemporary for
the Tudor period. They appear to have faithfully transcribed
original annals, but to this one important exception must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
made. The old writers never hesitated to record facts disagreeable
to the Church; the later compilers were under
the influence of the counter-reformation which produced
Jesuitism. Making some allowance for this, the &#8216;Four
Masters&#8217; must be considered fair men. Michael O&#8217;Clery
spent much time at Louvain, but he wrote in Ireland, and
had native assistants. Philip O&#8217;Sullivan, on the other hand,
was a Spanish officer, and published his useful but untrustworthy
&#8216;Compendium&#8217; at Lisbon. The &#8216;Annals of Lough Cé&#8217;
are preferable in some ways to the &#8216;Four Masters,&#8217; but they
do not cover so much ground. All the native annalists are
jejune to an exasperating degree. Genealogy seems to have
been the really important thing with them, and they throw
extremely little light on the condition of the people. We
are forced therefore to rely on the accounts, often prejudiced
and nearly always ill-informed, of English travellers and
officials.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Irish chronicles in &#8216;Holinshed&#8217; were written
by Richard Stanihurst, who dedicated his work to Sir Henry
Sidney, for the reign of Henry VIII., and after that by John
Hooker. Stanihurst, a native of Dublin, was not born till
1545. He has been thought an unpatriotic writer, and
excited the violent antipathy of O&#8217;Donovan; but he appears
to have been pretty well informed. The speeches which he
puts into the mouths of his characters must be considered
apocryphal, but as much may be said of like compositions in
all ages. Hooker was an actor in many of the events he
describes. He was a Protestant and an Englishman, prejudiced
no doubt, but not untruthful, and his statements are
often borne out by independent documents. Edmund Campion,
the Jesuit, wrote in Ireland under Sidney&#8217;s protection;
his very interesting work is less a history than a collection of
notes.</p>

<p>Other books, ancient and modern, are referred to in
the footnotes. Among living scholars, I desire to thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
Dr. W. K. Sullivan, of Cork, who had the great kindness to
correct the first chapter, and to furnish some valuable notes.
Hearty thanks are also due to the gentlemen at the Public
Record Office, and especially to Mr. W. D. Selby and Mr.
J. M. Thompson.</p>

<p>In making the index a few errors were discovered in the
text, and these have been noted as errata. Some mistakes
may still remain uncorrected, but I am not without hope that
they are neither many nor of much importance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scope of
the work.</div>

<p>The main object of this book is to describe in some detail,
and as impartially as possible, the dealings of England with
Ireland during the reigns of Henry VIII. and his three
children. As an introduction to the study of that period,
it seemed desirable to give some account of the course of
government during those 340 years which had elapsed since
the first Anglo-Norman set foot upon the Irish shore. And,
seeing that Teutonic invaders had effected a lodgment about
three centuries and a half before Henry II.&#8217;s accession, it
was hardly possible to avoid saying something about the
men who built the towns which enabled his subjects to keep
a firm grip upon the island. Lastly, it seemed well at the
very outset to touch lightly upon the peculiarities of that
Celtic system with which the King of England found himself
suddenly confronted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Roman
period.</div>

<p>Agricola took military possession of south-western Scotland
partly in the hope of being able to invade Ireland. He
had heard that the climate and people did not differ much
from those of Britain, and he knew that the harbours were
much frequented by merchants. He believed that annexation
would tend to consolidate the Roman power in Britain, Gaul,
and Spain, and kept by him for some time a petty Irish king
who had been expelled by his own tribe, and to whom he
professed friendship on the chance of turning him to account.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Agricola thought there would be no great difficulty in conquering
the island, which he rightly conjectured to be smaller
than Britain and larger than Sicily or Sardinia.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have often,&#8217; says Tacitus, &#8216;heard him say that Ireland
could be conquered and occupied with a single legion and a few
auxiliaries, and that the work in Britain would be easier if the
Roman arms could be made visible on all sides, and liberty, as
it were, removed out of sight.&#8217; Agricola, like many great men
after him, might have found the task harder than his barbarous
guest had led him to suppose; and in any case fate had not
ordained that Ireland should ever know the Roman Peace.
It was reserved for another petty king, after the lapse of
nearly 1,100 years, to introduce an organised foreign power

possessions were destined to be far greater than those of
Imperial Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Celtic
polity.</div>

<p>Setting aside all ethnological speculations as foreign to
the scope of this work, it may be sufficient to say that the
inhabitants of Ireland at the dawn of authentic history were
Celts, of the same grand division as the bulk of the Scots
Highlanders, but differing considerably from the people of
Wales. Their organisation in the twelfth century had not
passed beyond the tribal stage.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Irish
Monarchy
or Pentarchy.</div>

<p>There was a monarch of all Ireland, who had Meath&mdash;the
Middle&mdash;as his official appanage, and who reigned originally
at Tara. There were provincial kings of Ulster,
Munster, Leinster, and Connaught. A primacy was given
to the race of Niall, who lived presumably in the fourth and
fifth centuries, and from whom the O&#8217;Neills, O&#8217;Donnells, and
others trace their descent. The theory is thought to have
been pretty closely adhered to until the desertion of Tara in
the sixth century of our era. After that the over-king lived
in his own territory; but his authority was often disputed,
especially by Munster, the revolt of which province finally
broke up the old order.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Weakness
of the
Brehon
law.</div>

<p>Wars were frequent, and Irish Brehons, who were rather
legal experts than judges, exerted themselves to define rights
and liabilities, and to establish a peaceful polity. Perhaps in
laying down the law they sometimes rather stated their own
conception of what it ought to be than described the actual
state of things; much as Brahminical writers propounded a
theory of caste which cannot be reconciled with historical
truth. Neither the Church nor the Law had always original
power sufficient to enforce steady obedience. The Law might
be clear enough, but the central government was often too
weak to secure respect for the opinion of experts. Portia
might have argued like a very Daniel, but she could have
done nothing without the Duke behind her. In the absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of such an overpowering authority, the decisions of the
Brehons were little more than arbitrations which might be,
and probably often were, accepted as final, but on which
neither party could be compelled to act.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ireland
was outside
the
imperial
system.</div>

<p>In the treatise called the &#8216;Senchus Mór&#8217; there is a passage
which may be as old as the fourteenth century, in which it
is allowed that the nature of Irish royalty varied considerably
from time to time. &#8216;The King of Erin without opposition,&#8217;
says the writer or interpolator, &#8216;received stock from the
King of the Romans; or it was by the successor of Patrick
the stock is given to the King of Erin, that is, when the
seaports of Dublin, and Waterford, and Limerick, and the
seaports in general, are subject to him.&#8217; There is here an
attempt at once to bring Ireland within the pale of the
Empire, and to show that the Irish Church was independent.
It was natural that the Brehons should seek to introduce
their country into the circle of nations, but we know as a
matter of fact that the Empire never had anything to do with
Ireland. The passage quoted may have been inspired by a
wish to deny English supremacy by attorning, as it were, to
the superior lord. It is a tribute to the greatness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Empire more than anything else, and it was not thought of
until the Brehon law schools had fallen from their high
estate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The tribal
system.
The chief.</div>

<p>It was by giving stock that an Irish chief showed his
power and added to his wealth. There were lands attached
to his office, but his capital consisted of kine, and he extracted
a sort of rent by obliging his inferiors to give them
pasture. The number of cattle which he &#8216;grazed without
loss&#8217; upon other people&#8217;s ground was the measure of his
power and popularity. There were free tribesmen the
amount of whose obligation to their chief was strictly laid
down, though a greater quantity of stock might be voluntarily
taken under certain restrictions. But there were also
servile or semi-servile classes whose comparatively unprotected
condition placed them more or less in the power of
the chief to whose sept they were attached. An ambitious
chief would always have opportunities of aggrandisement,
and his wealth enabled him to support a mercenary force, and
to grow strong at the expense of his own and other tribes.
Broken men who had lost their own tribal position would
always flock to an ambitious chief, and the disturbing influence
of such retainers was often too strong for Brehons or
priests. But the growth of power by means of mercenaries
was not peculiar to Ireland, and was perhaps less frequent
than is commonly supposed.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Frequency
of war.</div>

<p>Whatever the advantages of a pure Celtic system, it did
not secure general peace. There is no period of which Celtic
Ireland may be more justly proud than that between the
death of St. Columba in 597 and the death of St. Gall about
640. It was the age in which the Irish saint Columbanus
bearded Thierri and Brunehaut, in which Ireland herself was
a noted seat of learning, and in which the monasteries of
Luxueil, of St. Gall, and of Bobbio were founded by Irishmen.
Yet, under thirty years out of forty-four either battle or
murder is recorded in the <cite>Chronicon Scotorum</cite>. In some
years there were several battles and several murders.</p>

<p>In 628 Leinster was devastated. Quarrels between near
relations were frequent, and often ended in murder. When
we consider that the deaths of important people only are
recorded, we cannot pronounce the Ireland which sent forth
Aidan, and Adamnan, and Columbanus to have been at all a
peaceful country. Christianity was then established, and no
Scandinavian irruption had yet hindered the development of
purely native ideas. But Irish chroniclers, perhaps owing
to their genealogical turn, give a disproportionate space to
deaths; and it may be admitted that the number of homicides
was not greater in Ireland than in some parts of Germany in
feudal times.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Celtic law
of succession.</div>

<p>Primogeniture, which is practically incompatible with the
tribal stage of political organisation, was perhaps formally
acknowledged at a very remote period, but was unknown as
a rule of succession to Irish chiefries in the ages with which
this book chiefly deals. In those comparatively modern times
a vacancy was filled from the same family, but the person
chosen was generally a brother or a cousin of the deceased.
It seldom happened, perhaps, that an Irish chief, who was
necessarily a warrior, attained threescore and ten years, and
on an average a son would be less likely to make an able
leader than one of an older generation. To avoid disputed
successions, an heir-apparent, called the tanist, was chosen
before a vacancy actually occurred, and sometimes probably
against the wish of the reigning chief. Very often the sons
refused to accept the tanist, and bloody quarrels followed.
This system stank in the nostrils of the Tudor lawyers; but
in the twelfth century the true principle of hereditary succession
was not fully understood. It was, perhaps, a suspicion
that his eldest son might not succeed him quietly that induced
Henry II. to crown him in his lifetime. A later and
much stronger analogy may be found in the history of the
Empire. Charles V. procured the election of his brother
Ferdinand as king of the Romans, and he was actually
crowned. Many years later Charles wished to substitute his
son Philip; but Ferdinand refused to yield, and he was sustained
by the electors, who had no mind to see the Empire
become an appendage of the Spanish monarchy. The influence
of the Irish Brehons probably tended to prevent chiefries
from becoming hereditary. In such cases as the earldom of
Desmond we have a mixture of the two systems; the earls
were chiefs as regarded the Irish; but their succession to the
honour, and through it to the quasi-chiefry, was regulated by
feudal rules.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tudor
view of the
Celtic land
law.</div>

<p>As the chief was elected by his tribe from among a limited
number, so was the land distributed among the tribesmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
within certain fixed limits. As it is with England&#8217;s treatment
of Ireland that we have to do, it may be as well to let
Sir John Davies himself say how the matter appeared to the
Tudor lawyers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Septs.</div>

<p>&#8216;First be it known that the lands possessed by the mere
Irish in this realm were divided into several territories or
countries; and the inhabitants of each Irish country were
divided into several septs or lineages.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord and
tanist.</div>

<p>&#8216;Secondly, in every Irish territory there was a lord or
chieftain, and a tanist who was his successor apparent. And
of every Irish sept or lineage there was also a chief, who was
called Canfinny, or head of a &#8220;cognatio.&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tanistry
and gavelkind.</div>

<p>&#8216;Thirdly, all possessions in these Irish territories (before
the common law of England was established through all the
realm as it now is) ran at all times<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in course of tanistry, or
in course of gavelkind. Every lordship or chiefry, with the
portion of land that passed with it, went without partition to
the tanist, who always came in by election, or by the strong
hand, and never by descent.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But all the inferior tenancies
were partible among the males in gavelkind.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">No estate of
inheritance.</div>

<p>&#8216;Again, the estate which the lord had in the chiefry, or
that the inferior tenants had in gavelkind, was no estate of
inheritance, but a temporary or transitory possession. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
just as the next heir of the lord or chieftain would not inherit
the chiefry, but the eldest and worthiest of the sept (as was
before shown in the case of tanistry), who was often removed
and expelled by another who was more active or stronger
than he: so lands in the nature of gavelkind were not partible
among the next heirs male of him who died seised, but
among all the males of his sept, in this manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Partitions
of tribal
land.</div>

<p>&#8216;The Canfinny, or chief of a sept (who was commonly the
most ancient of the sept) made all the partitions at his discretion.
This Canfinny, after the death of each tenant
holding a competent portion of land, assembled all the sept,
placed all their possessions in hotchpotch, and made a new
partition of the whole; in which partition he did not assign
to the sons of the deceased the portion which their father
held, but allotted the better or larger part to each one of the
sept according to his antiquity.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
frequent
partitions.</div>

<p>&#8216;These portions being thus allotted and assigned were
possessed and enjoyed accordingly until the next partition,
which, at the discretion or will of the Canfinny, might be
made at the death of each inferior tenant. And thus by these
frequent partitions and the removals or translations of the
tenants of one portion or another, all the possessions were
uncertain, and the uncertainty of possession was the very
cause that no civil habitations were erected, and no enclosure
or improvement of lands made, in the Irish countries where
that custom of gavelkind was in use; especially in Ulster,
which seemed everywhere a wilderness before this new plantation
made there by the English undertakers. And this was
the fruit of this Irish gavelkind.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of
daughters
and of bastard
sons.</div>

<p>&#8216;Also by this Irish custom of gavelkind bastards took
their shares with the legitimate, and wives, on the other
hand, were quite excluded from dower, and daughters took
nothing, even if their father died without issue male. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
that this custom differed from Kentish gavelkind in four
points.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Four points
peculiar to
Irish
gavelkind.</div>

<p>The four points were the certainty of estate in each share,
the exclusion of bastards, the admission of a widow to one
moiety, and the admission of females in default of issue male.
For which reasons, says Sir John, the Kentish custom was
always held good and lawful by the law of England. He
admits, however, that the Irish custom had a counterpart
in North Wales, which had been totally abolished by Henry
VIII., along with other usages resembling those of Ireland.
Edward I. had only ventured to exclude bastards, and to
give widows their dowry.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir John
Davies did
not exhaust
the subject.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the above decision, it is probable that a
description of tanistry and gavelkind does not exhaust the
subject. The theoretical division among all the males of a
sept is not at all likely to have been carried out, except in
very early times. Human nature was against it. From the
twelfth century the example of the Anglo-Normans, which
cannot have been altogether without weight, was against it.
The interest of the chief was everywhere against it, because it
would deprive him of the means of rewarding his friends, and
because he was always tempted to seize lands to his own use.
The tendency to private property would be always asserting
itself, but the exact historical truth can never be known.
Before the close of the mediæval period, a great part of
Ireland had been reconquered by the tribes from Anglo-Norman
hands. Is it possible that the Irish land system can
have been anywhere restored in its integrity? On the whole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
it is at least probable that English statesmen in the sixteenth
century made as many mistakes about tenures in Ireland as
their representatives in the eighteenth and part of the nineteenth
made about tenures in India. Good faith may be
generally granted in both cases, but the blunders made were
no less disastrous. It is at all events clear that primogeniture
was no Celtic usage, that it is no part of the law of
nature, and that the Tudor lawyers treated it as an end in
itself, and almost as a necessary element in the eternal fitness
of things. In the twelfth century Irish practice may have
come much nearer to theory than in the sixteenth; at all
events, Henry II.&#8217;s grants to individuals were absolutely
opposed to Celtic notions of justice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conflict

history.</div>

<p>The Irish admitted composition for murder. This blood-fine,
called an <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">eric</i>, was an utter abomination to the English
of the sixteenth century, who had quite forgotten the laws
and customs of their own Teutonic ancestors. To men long
used to a strong central government such a custom seemed
impious. It was nevertheless part of the common heritage of
the Aryan race, and had been in vogue among the peoples
from whom the later English sprung. The Njal Saga illustrates
its use among the Icelanders by many famous cases
strictly in point. The feudal system and the canon law had
caused the Teutonic nations to abandon a usage which they
once had in common with the Irish. Celtic Ireland had never
had a very strong central government, and such as it was it
had sustained serious damage. Homicide was still considered
a personal injury. The rule was not a life for a life, but
adequate damages for the loss sustained. The idea of public
justice, irrespective of private interests, was far in advance
of the stage which had been reached by the Irish Celts.
Irish history cannot be understood unless the fact is clearly
grasped, that the development of the tribal system was
violently interrupted by a feudal half-conquest. The Angevin
and Plantagenet kings were strong enough to shake and
discredit the native polity; but they had neither the power
nor the inclination to feudalise a people which had never
gone through the preliminary stages. When the Tudors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
brought a more steadfast purpose and better machinery to
the task, they found how hard it was to evolve order out of
the shattered remnants of two systems which had the same
origin, but which had been so brought together as to make
complete fusion impossible. From the first the subjects of
England and the natives of Ireland had been on entirely
different planes. Even for us it is extremely difficult to
avoid confusion by applying modern terms to ancient things.
The Tudor lawyers and statesmen could hardly even attempt
to look at jarring systems from the outside. They saw that
the common law was more advanced than that of the Brehons,
but they could not see that they were really the same thing
at different stages. In fact, plain Englishmen in the sixteenth
century could not do what only the most enlightened Anglo-Indians
can do in the nineteenth. They were more civilised
than the Irish, but they were not educated enough to
recognise the common ancestor. That there was a common
ancestor, and that neither party could recognise him, is the
key to Anglo-Irish history both before and after the Tudor
times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exile of

<div class="sidenote">Saint
Bridget.</div>

<p>The early history of the native Irish Church is shrouded
in much obscurity. The best authorities are disposed to
accept St. Patrick as the apostle of Ireland, the fifth century
as the period of his labours, and Armagh as his chief seat.
He was not a native of Ireland; so much seems certain. A
more interesting, because a more clearly defined figure, is
that of Columba or Columkille, who was born in Donegal in
521. The churches of Derry, Durrow, Kells, Swords, Raphoe,
Tory Island, and Drumcliff, claim him as their founder; but
it is as the apostle of North Britain that he is best known.
He was religious from his youth, but a peculiarly serious
tinge was given to his mind by a feeling of remorse for
bloodshed which he had partly caused. He had surreptitiously
transcribed a psalter belonging to another saint, who
complained of this primitive infringement of copyright. A
royal decision that &#8216;to every cow belongs her calf&#8217; was given,
and was followed by an appeal to arms. Exile was then imposed
as a penance on Columba, whose act had been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
original cause of offence. Such was long the received legend,
but perhaps the exile was voluntary.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Whether his departure
was a penance or the result of a vow, tradition says that he
was bound never to see Ireland again, that he landed first
on Oronsay, but found that Erin was visible from thence,
and refused to rest until he had reached Iona. His supposed
feelings are recorded in a very ancient poem:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Columba was the Paul of Celtic Christianity. By him and
his disciples a great part of Scotland was evangelised, and it
was to him that the British Church looked as a founder when
the time came to decide between the relative pretensions of
the Celtic and the Norman type of religion. St. Bridget or
Bride, who died four years after Columba&#8217;s birth, is scarcely
less celebrated. She was born near Dundalk, and her chief
seat was at Kildare. She was the mother of Irish female
monachism, and in popular estimation is not less famous than
Patrick, and perhaps more so than Columba.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Irish
Church was
originally
monastic.</div>

<p>Irish Christianity was at first monastic. A saint obtained
a grant of land from a chief. A church was built, and a
settlement sprung up round it. The family, as it was called,
consisted partly of monks and partly of dependents, and the
abbot ruled over all as chief of a pseudo-tribe. Like a lay
chiefry the abbacy was elective, and the abbots wielded considerable
power. These ecclesiastical clans even made war
with each other. Thus, it is recorded that in 763 the family
of St. Ciaran of Clonmacnoise fought with the family of St.
Columba of Durrow, and that 200 of the Columbides fell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
The head of such a confraternity was called coarb, or successor
of the founder, and Irish writers sometimes called the
Pope &#8216;coarb of Peter.&#8217; In course of time the coarb of
Patrick crystallised into the Archbishop of Armagh, and
the coarb of Columba into the Bishop of Derry. Other
saints were revered as the founders of other sees. Very
often at least the abbot was chosen from among the founder&#8217;s
kin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The early
Church was
episcopal,
but not territorially
so.</div>

<p>Episcopal orders were acknowledged from the first, but
it was long before the notion of a territorial bishop prevailed.
In early days there were many bishops, wanderers sometimes,
and at other times retained by the abbot as a necessary
appendage to his monastery. The bishop was treated with
great respect, but was manifestly inferior to the head of a
religious house. St. Patrick was said to have consecrated
350 bishops, founded 700 churches, and ordained 5,000
priests; a mere legend, but perhaps tending to show that
the episcopal order was very numerous in Ireland. Travelling
bishops without definite duties, and with orders of
doubtful validity, became a scandal to more regularly organised
churches, and drew down a rebuke from Anselm as
late as the beginning of the twelfth century. At an earlier
period impostors pretending to be Irish bishops were not
uncommon.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ireland
gradually
conformed
to Roman
usage.</div>

<p>The Irish Church long continued to keep Easter on a
different day from that sanctioned by Rome, and to use a different
form of tonsure. But the inconvenience of such dissidence
from the general body of Western Christendom was
soon felt. About 630 Pope Honorius I. addressed a letter to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Irish Church, in which he reminded the clergy that they were
a scanty company inhabiting a remote region, and that it
could not be for their interest to remain isolated. Cummian,
afterwards seventh abbot of Iona, warmly espoused the papal
cause. &#8216;Rome errs,&#8217; he said with great scorn, &#8216;Jerusalem
errs, Alexandria errs, Antioch errs, the whole world errs&mdash;the
Britons and Irish are the only right-minded people.&#8217; The
southern Irish followed Cummian, but the northern rejected
his advice, and some even called him a heretic; yet this did
not prevent his being elected to fill Columba&#8217;s chair. Adamnan,
ninth abbot of Iona, and biographer of the great founder,
was no less earnest on the Roman side than Cummian had
been. At the Synod of Whitby in 664 Wilfred discomfited
Colman of Lindisfarne, and settled the question so far as
England was concerned. Adamnan lived till 704, and succeeded
in converting nearly all the Irish churches, except those
subject to his own monastery.</p>

<p>In 716, under Duncadh, the eleventh abbot, Iona conformed,
and the Paschal controversy came to an end, after
lasting 150 years. The coronal tonsure was adopted three
years later. The supremacy of Rome was thus acknowledged,
but circumstances long prevented the Irish from adopting the
Roman plan of Church organisation.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian inroads began towards the close of the
century which witnessed the submission of Iona. It is probable
that the influx of pagan Northmen kept Ireland apart
from the rest of Christendom. The ninth century produced
Erigena and other eminent Irishmen, but a country in which
Christianity was fighting for bare life was not a promising
field for Church reformers or systematisers. It was not until
Clontarf had finally decided the cause in favour of Christianity
that Ireland had again leisure to think of ecclesiastical
polity. Gillebert of Limerick, an Ostman, was the first papal
legate, and as such presided at the synod of Rathbreasil in or
about 1118, where the first serious attempt was made to
divide all Ireland into dioceses. The great influence of
Malachi of Armagh was exerted in the same direction. He
was the friend of Bernard of Clairvaux, and he introduced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Cistercian order into Ireland. Pope Eugenius III., himself
a Cistercian, finished the work, and in 1151 Ireland accepted
four archiepiscopal palls from Rome. From that date the
Irish Church must be held to have fully accepted not only
papal supremacy but Roman organisation. That she had not
done so long before seems due to accident more than anything
else. From mere remoteness of position Ireland had escaped
the dominion of Imperial Rome. From the same remoteness
she was comparatively slow to feel the influence of Papal
Rome. Still, it can scarcely be doubted that had it not been
for the Scandinavian intrusion, the Ireland which adopted the
Roman Easter and the Roman tonsure before the middle of
the eighth century, would have gladly accepted the palls long
before the middle of the twelfth.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> As to the divisions and sub-divisions of the ancient Irish people, I
prefer to give the following statement of Dr. Sullivan:&mdash;&#8216;The unit territory
was the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tuath</i>, each of which had a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ri</i>, or chief. Three, four, or even
more <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tuatha</i> were connected together for military and other purposes as a
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Mór Tuath</i>; the king or chief of the confederacy, who acted as Commander-in-Chief,
was the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ri Mór Tuatha</i>, or great chief. This group corresponded
to the Gothic <i lang="got" xml:lang="got">Thiuda</i>, old Norse <i lang="non" xml:lang="non">Thjoth</i>. The Irish unit <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tuath</i> corresponded
to the Norse <i lang="non" xml:lang="non">Fylk</i>, the Teutonic <i lang="got" xml:lang="got">Gavi</i> or <i lang="got" xml:lang="got">Gau</i>, the Greek <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Phyle</i>, and the old
Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tribus</i>; it was at first genealogical, but acquired a geographical and
political signification. The tribe or <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tuath</i> consisted in some cases of a
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Clann</i>, the progeny or descendants of a chief. Sometimes a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Clann</i> embraced
several <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tuatha</i>. <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Clann</i> was strictly genealogical, <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tuath</i> both genealogical
and geographical. The <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Clann</i> consisted of families or houses called
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Fine</i>, equivalent to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cognatio</i>&mdash;the Anglo-Saxon <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Maegth</i>. The head of a
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Fine</i> was the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Cendfinne</i> or chieftain. The <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Fine</i> was a sept. The <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Clann</i>
therefore consisted of several septs, and the land of the tribe or <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tuath</i> was
divided between the septs or <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Fine</i> composing it. The <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Fine</i> or sept is one
of the most important parts of the Irish organisation, but the word is used
in several senses: thus, the relatives of a chief or other tribesman to the
fifth degree constituted the true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cognatio</i> or <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Geilfine</i>, i.e. Hand-<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">fine</i>. The
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Fine</i> or sept was in fact an independent unit, which paid <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Erics</i> for all its
members, and received <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Erics</i> or fines for the killing of one of its own
members, and also took possession of the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Dibad</i> or property of its deceased
members. But when the sept did not fulfil its obligations, the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ri</i> of the
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tuath</i> was bound to enforce justice. So when the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tuath</i> itself failed in its
obligations and duties, the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ri Mór Tuatha</i> or superior chief was bound to
enforce justice in the recalcitrant tribe. The <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ri Mór Tuatha</i>, or <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ri buiden</i>,
or king of companies, corresponded to the Anglo-Saxon <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Heretoga</i> or  <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dux</span>.
The King of the Great Tribe received hostages from the sub-reguli of his
territory for their <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ceílsine</i> or fealty, and he might call upon them to support
him with a levy of their tribes.&#8217;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> &#8216;The existence of the Irish Pentarchy,&#8217; says Dr. Sullivan, &#8216;was as real
as that of any similar confederacy among nations in a tribal stage, and the
means of enforcing the orders of the over-king were not very different or
less effective than in many federal states&mdash;ancient, mediæval, and modern.&#8217;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> &#8216;It is quite true,&#8217; says Dr. Sullivan, &#8216;that the central power was not
always strong enough to enforce rights, and in many instances was defeated
in its attempt to do so. But in what does this differ from other federal
states, ancient and modern? The Emperors of Germany were not always
able to subdue and to enforce their decrees against the princes and nobles
of the Empire, and in numerous instances the decisions of the imperial
chancery might be regarded in precisely the same light&mdash;as mere arbitrations.
To say there was no law, properly speaking, seems to me wholly irreconcilable
with actual facts, and <em>especially with the existence of a rich and
elaborate nomenclature of native terms not borrowed from Roman law</em>. This
nomenclature implies an equally elaborate machinery. It was the existence
of this legal system which kept out the canon law, which never, for instance,
succeeded in suppressing or even modifying the marriage customs. In
discussing the laws and institutions of early nations we are liable to go to
one or other of two extremes:&mdash;(1) We represent the laws, &amp;c., in terms of
modern law, by which we make inchoate institutions full-grown, while the
germs of a legal system are represented as a fully developed code; or (2)
we deny the existence of all law and legislation. You are right I think
as regards the Church; for owing to the organisation of the old Celtic
Church it was perfectly acephalous. Whatever influence it did exert was
individual and never official, and, therefore, not continuous&mdash;it might be
described in fact as sporadic influence.&#8217;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> &#8216;All through the laws,&#8217; says Dr. Sullivan, &#8216;there is ample evidence to
prove that the tribesmen, or <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Aires</i>, were bound to take stock from the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ri</i>,
or chief, only. The amount of this stock, called <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Saer</i>, or free-stock, is
strictly laid down, and the amount of the tribute payable for this stock,
called <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Bestigi</i>, or house-refection, or tribute, is also strictly laid down. But
if the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ri</i> were wealthy he might offer more stock to his <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ceiles</i>, clients or
vassals, on condition of paying him certain dues, called <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Biatad</i>. The
stock so given was called <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Daer</i>, or base-stock; and its acceptance by a
tribesman made a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Daer-ceilé</i> of him, and placed him very much in the
power of the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ri</i>, or chief. No tribesman could accept <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Daer-stock</i> without
the consent of his <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Fine</i>, or sept, which would be bound by the acts of
its members. A tribesman, with the consent of his <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Fine</i>, might accept
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Daer-stock</i> from any <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Flath</i>, or lord, in his own <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tuath</i>, or tribe. All the
above applies to the tribesmen, or <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Aires</i>, who alone constituted the free
class. But besides the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ceiles</i>, or clients, or free tribesmen, or <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Aires</i>, there
was another class, called <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Fuidirs</i>. The markland of the tribe and the land
held in severalty of the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ri</i>, and the similar land of the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Cendfinne</i>, or chieftain
(or captain, as he is called in the Scottish Highlands) of a sept was
let out to various classes of <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Fuidirs</i>. Some were <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Saer</i>, or free <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Fuidirs</i>, and
others <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Daer</i>, or base Fuidirs. The <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Saer-fuidirs</i>, again, were of two sorts&mdash;broken
tribesmen who went into another <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tuath</i> and got stock as well as
land from a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ri</i>, or <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Flath</i>, and <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Saer-fuidirs</i> who possessed some stock of
their own which they grazed on land of a chief or of a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Flath</i>. Some of
these free <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Fuidirs</i> entered into <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">daer</i>, or servitude, by accepting stock under
certain conditions. The <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Fuidir</i> classes were the true tenants at will. The
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Aires</i> were of the clan, the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Fuidirs</i>, <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Bottachs</i>, or cottiers, and other servile
classes, <em>belonged</em> to the clan. The giving and taking of <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Daer-stock</i> depended
upon the impoverishment of a sept through cattle murrain, the levying of
blood-fines on account of the misconduct of some of its members, &amp;c.
But the whole thing was voluntary, and depended on the poverty of a sept
and the wealth and ability of the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ri</i>, or <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Flath</i>.&#8217;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Dr. Sullivan does not think Christianity was fully established by the
middle of the seventh century. &#8216;The Irish Church organisation,&#8217; he says,
&#8216;was ill calculated to influence the social habits and the political life of
the people; unlike the diocesan and centralised system of the Latin
Church. Hence a high spiritual life and intellectual cultivation within
the numerous c&oelig;nobiums was quite compatible with practical paganism
and disorder outside.&#8217;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> &#8216;At all times&#8217; must be understood to refer only to those comparatively

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> &#8216;The election,&#8217; says Dr. Sullivan, &#8216;was always from the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Geilfine</i>, or
relatives within the fifth degree. Should the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Geilfine</i> fail, or be all killed
in battle, the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Derbfine</i>, or relatives from the fifth to the ninth degree,
came in.&#8217;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> &#8216;This,&#8217; says Dr. Sullivan, &#8216;is not right. There was the &#8220;joint undivided
family&#8221; formed by the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Bo-aire</i> class, or freemen possessed of cattle.
The poorer <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Flaths</i>, or heads of septs, did not gavel their possessions, but
either elected a tanist or formed a &#8220;joint undivided family.&#8221; When the
property of an <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Aire</i> was not sufficient to gavel, so as to qualify one or more
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Aires</i>, the division of the inheritance did not take place, but the parties
agreed to form a &#8220;<em>joint</em> undivided family.&#8221; In such a family one was head,
and as such was an <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Aire</i>. <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Bo-aires</i> of this class, to avoid the gavelling of
their property, elected a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tanist</i>&mdash;the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tanaise Bo-aire</i>. Poor and broken
tribesmen, not having sufficient wealth to qualify them as <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Aires</i>, formed a
&#8220;joint-family,&#8221; or <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Congilda</i>. Every <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Flath</i>, or head of a sept, had a tanist
also. The Irish &#8220;joint-family&#8221; was an institution of great importance and
of surpassing interest in the comparative history of the Aryan family.&#8217;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> &#8216;This account of Davies,&#8217; says Dr. Sullivan, &#8216;is entirely wrong. The
law of the distribution of the property of a deceased tribesman was most
carefully laid down. No doubt then as now, and naturally more frequently
then than now, a chief, or head of a sept, or of a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Treb</i> (homestead) might
usurp power he did not possess, and do wrong.&#8217;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> &#8216;Marriages in Ireland,&#8217; says Dr. Sullivan, &#8216;were not regulated by canon
law. The Irish marriage customs were in full force long after the Norman
conquest. According to these customs, which appear to have been wholly
uninfluenced by the canon law, bastardy was entirely different from what
that term implied in countries under canon law, and in modern times. The
Irish marriage customs should consequently be taken into account here, as
they sanctioned a kind of polygamy, divorce, &amp;c. See also the excommunication
in 1282, by the Archbishop of Canterbury against Llewellyn,
Prince of Wales, at the request of Edward I., in which the marriage
customs of the Welsh, identical with those of the Irish, constitute one of
the charges.&#8217;</p></div>

phases of monasticism: one that of the Patrician period&mdash;an obscure but
highly important and interesting phase; the other, that of the sixth and
subsequent centuries, to which the Irish missionaries belonged.&#8217;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> &#8216;Besides,&#8217; says Dr. Sullivan, &#8216;the monastic bishop proper, who furnished
the wandering Scotic bishops of the Middle Ages, there is a later
development of a higher church organisation in the tribal bishop, who was
a close approximation to a diocesan bishop. The tribal bishop was a
bishop who had jurisdiction over the whole of a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tuath</i>, and sometimes
even a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Mór Tuath</i>. The growth of territorial jurisdiction is well marked
by the prestige attached to the office&mdash;the bishop ranked in fact almost on
a level with the chief, and was entitled to the same legal retinue. Many
of the ancient dioceses, and some of the existing ones, <i>e.g.</i> Ross, Kilmacduagh,
Kilfenora, represent ancient <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tuaths</i>, or tribe territories. Several
deaneries were former dioceses, and are co-extensive with ancient <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tuatha</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Dr. Sullivan warns me not to attribute too much influence to the
Danish Church. &#8216;The tribe-bishop,&#8217; he says, &#8216;was a much earlier development,
and proves the growth of diocesan jurisdiction and the consequent
merging of the Irish Church in the Latin Church. The acceptance of the
Roman time for celebrating Easter by the Irish Church and the constant
intercourse between Ireland and the Continent had brought the Irish Church
fully under Roman supremacy three and a half centuries earlier. What
really took place in the early part of the twelfth century was the more complete
adoption of the organisation of the Western Church, and of the
principles of the canon law; and especially the granting of lands and
charters to the Church in the same way as in feudal lands. The marriage
of Irish princes with Saxon and other foreign princesses, and the growth
of towns which helped to relax its rigid tribal system, did more than the
Danish Church.&#8217; The chief towns were, however, of Danish origin.</p></div>

<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SCANDINAVIAN ELEMENT.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">First appearance
of
the Northmen,
795.</div>

<p>Norwegian ships began to appear on the Irish coast in 795,
one year after the destruction of the church at Lindisfarne.
The islands were harried, Lambay being perhaps the first to
suffer; everything of value was taken, and the hermits and
anchorites were killed or carried away. Iona, where the
greatest of Irish saints had founded a new Church, was burned
or plundered in 802 and 806. About twelve years after their
first visit the Scandinavians began to venture inland, sacking
the monasteries, which contained such wealth as Ireland then
possessed, and slaughtering the monks. The famous religious
community at Bangor, in Down, was thus destroyed about
824. The first permanent settlement of the northern invaders
was perhaps in the neighbourhood of Limerick. They had a
fort at Cork before 848, and at Dublin before 852. There
were also forts on Lough Foyle and at Waterford. The flat
coast between Dublin and the borders of Meath lay open to
a floating enemy, and early obtained the name of Fingal, or
the land of the stranger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turgesius,
830.</div>

<p>In or about 830 a chief arrived who pursued a more ambitious
policy. He is called Turgeis or Turgesius by the
Irish, and by the Irish only: this may be a form of Thorkils
or Trygve, and may perhaps be a name applied to the mysterious
hero whom the Scandinavians call Ragnar Lodbrok.
Turgesius landed in Ulster, and planned the complete subjugation
of Ireland. He burned Armagh and drove out St.
Patrick&#8217;s successor, and then took up a central position
near Athlone, whence his flotillas could act on Lough Ree
and Lough Dearg. We know that the Northmen dragged
ships or boats overland to Loch Lomond, and similar feats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
may have been performed in Ireland. There was another
plundering station on Lough Neagh about the same time.</p>

<p>Turgeis mastered the northern half of Ireland, and made
frequent incursions into the other half. Against the Church
he showed peculiar animosity, and his wife used the high
altar at Clonmacnoise as a throne when she gave audience;
perhaps she uttered oracular responses from it. In the south
Turgeis was less powerful, for the dispossessed abbot of
Armagh took refuge at Emly in Tipperary. But the whole
coast was attacked by innumerable corsairs, who sometimes
made raids far into the central districts. Dublin was fortified
by the Norwegians about 840, and became the chief seat of
the Scandinavian power. Turgeis did not live to unite the
various bands, but fell into the hands of Malachi, King of
Meath, in 845, and was drowned in Lough Owel. The Northmen
of Limerick were defeated in the same year at Roscrea,
and their earl, Olfin, was slain.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 852.<br />
<br />
The Black
and White
Gentiles.</div>

<p>Seven years after the death of Turgeis came the Black
Gentiles, who are generally supposed to have been Danes,
as the White Gentiles were certainly Norwegians. Whether
the colour of their armour or their complexion was
referred to is doubtful. The new-comers made themselves
masters of Dublin, and of the plunder which the first invaders
had accumulated from all the Irish churches. Before
one of the battles fought to decide whether Black or White
Pagans were to enjoy this property, Horm, or Gorm, the
Danish chief, is said to have invoked St. Patrick, a singular
confusion of ideas, which may have resulted from intercourse
with Christians in England. Victory followed. The Black
Gentiles seem to have retained their supremacy; but the distinction
becomes partly obliterated, and the Danes, of whom
we read later, were probably intermingled with Norwegians.
It is recorded that Amlaf, son of the King of Norway, came
to Ireland in 852 or 853, that all the foreigners of Erin submitted
to him, and that the Irish also paid tribute. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
name of the Black Gentiles is believed to be preserved in the
little town of Baldoyle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forty
years&#8217;
peace.</div>

<p>Amlaf and his sons were not satisfied with the spoils of
thrice plundered churches, but everywhere violated tombs in
search of gold ornaments. Another great chief was Ivar,
who appears to have been Ivar Beinlaus, son of Ragnar
Lodbrok, and founder of the Northumbrian kingdom, which
was afterwards closely connected with the Irish Danes. To
the Norwegians who fled to Ireland from the iron rule of
Harold Harfager, the King of Dublin was one of the chief
sovereigns on earth. Carrol, lord of Ossory, was in alliance
with Amlaf and Ivar, and ruled Dublin after their deaths;
but he died about 885, and a Norse dynasty was then re-established
by force. A dozen years later another Carrol drove
the foreigners across the Channel, but Sitric, king of Northumberland,
regained the fortress in 919, and the Celts do not
appear to have recaptured it. For a period of some forty
years, ending about 916, Ireland is said to have had a little
rest. The enemy may have had enough to do elsewhere, but
their predatory expeditions did not entirely cease. There were
perhaps no fresh invasions in force, but former settlers held
their own against the Irish, with whom they were generally
at war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Renewed
invasions,
916.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Severe
treatment
of the
natives.</div>

<p>Whatever may have caused the period of comparative rest,
the Danish incursions began again with renewed vigour. A
great host came to Waterford in 916, defeated the men of
Leinster, and harried all the south of Ireland; churches, as
usual, attracting their special attention. Ragnal, Ivar&#8217;s grandson,
represented by the Ulster annalists as king of all the Irish
Scandinavians, was the chief leader, and he afterwards led
his men to Scotland, where the great but indecisive battle of
Tynemoor was fought.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Sitric, Ragnal&#8217;s brother, took Dublin
from the Irish, who had, perhaps, held it since 902, and on
Ragnal&#8217;s death succeeded to the royal title. The natives
had occasional successes, but on the whole they were conspicuously
inferior in the field, and Nial Glundubh, King of
Ireland, who headed a great confederacy, fell in the attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
to recover Dublin. Twelve chiefs or kings of northern and
central tribes are said to have died at the same time. After
this reverse all serious attempt to check the invaders seems
to have been given up, and fleet after fleet brought hordes of
oppressors to the ill-fated island. Munster suffered especially,
and the general nature of a Danish invasion cannot be better
apprehended than by transcribing the chronicler&#8217;s words:&mdash;&#8216;And
assuredly the evil which Erin had hitherto suffered was
as nothing compared to the evil inflicted by these parties.
All Munster was plundered by them on all sides and devastated,
and they spread themselves over Munster and built
earth-works and towers and landing-places over all Erin, so
that there was no place in Erin without numerous fleets of
Danes and pirates; so that they made spoil-land and sword-land
and conquered-land of her throughout her breadth and
generally; and they ravaged her chieftainries, privileged
churches, and sanctuaries, and demolished her shrines, reliquaries,
and books. They wrecked her beautiful ornamental
temples: for neither veneration, nor honour, nor mercy for
holy ground, nor protection for church or sanctuary, for God
or man, was felt by this furious, ferocious, pagan, ruthless,
wrathful people. In short, until the sand of the sea, the
grass of the field, or the stars of heaven are counted it will
not be easy to recount or enumerate or relate what the Gaedhil,
all, without distinction, suffered from; whether men or women,
boys or girls, laics or clerics, freemen or serfs, young or old;
indignity, outrage, injury, and oppression. In a word, they
killed the kings and the chieftains, the heirs to the crown, and
the royal princes of Erin. They killed the brave and the
valiant, the stout knights, champions, soldiers, and young
lords, and most of the heroes and warriors of all Ireland;
they brought them under tribute and reduced them to bondage
and slavery. Many were the blooming, lively women;
the modest, mild, comely maidens; the pleasant, noble, stately,
blue-eyed young women; the gentle, well-brought-up youths;
and the intelligent, valiant champions, whom they carried to
oppression and bondage over the broad green sea. Alas!
many and frequent were the bright eyes that were suffused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
with tears and dimmed with grief and despair at the separation
of son from father, and daughter from mother, and brother
from brother, and relatives from their race and from their
tribe.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Northmen

permanent
kingdom.</div>

<p>The Irish Danes became strong enough to interfere with
effect in English politics, and Olaf Cuaran, or Sitricson,
King of Dublin, was a general of the great Scandinavian
army which Athelstane overthrew at Brunanburgh. The
Danes were much fewer than the Irish, but their general
superiority during the tenth century was incontestable; and
had the invaded people been of kin to them the kingdom of
Canute might have had a counterpart in Ireland. Irish Celts
were only too ready to call in Scandinavian allies in their
internal quarrels, but they could never amalgamate with
them. Occasionally a confederation of tribes would gain a
great success, as at the battle of Tara, where King Malachi
defeated the Dublin Danes under Athelstane&#8217;s old opponent,
Olaf Cuaran. After great slaughter on both sides the Dublin
men had the worst, and were forced to release Donnell, King
of Leinster, who was then in their hands. A great part of
Ireland was at this time subject to the Danes, and the battle
of Tara has been called the end of the &#8216;Babylonish captivity
of Ireland, inferior only to the captivity of hell.&#8217; King Olaf
went on a pilgrimage to Iona, where he died in the following
year. Thirty-seven years had passed since his acceptance of
Christianity, at least in name; yet the Danes plundered the
sacred isle only five years later, in 986, and killed the abbot
and fifteen of his monks. It is to be noted that the Scandinavian
treatment of churches reacted on the Irish, and
that many native warriors came to regard saints and sanctuaries
with as little respect as Turgesius himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
strongest
power in
Munster.</div>

<p>Munster seems to have been more completely subdued
than any other part of Ireland. The Danish stations at
Waterford, Cork, and Limerick made invasion at all times
easy, and the sons of Ivar bid fair to found a lasting dynasty
at the latter place. There was a tax-gatherer in every petty
district, a receiver to intercept the dues of every church, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>

Erin ... had power to give even the milk of his cow, nor
as much as the clutch of eggs of one hen in succour or in
kindness to an aged man, or to a friend, but was forced to
preserve them for the foreign steward, or bailiff, or soldier.
And though there were but one milk-giving cow in the house
she durst not be milked for an infant of one night, nor for a
sick person, but must be kept for the steward, or bailiff, or
soldier of the foreigners. And however long he might be
absent from his house, his share or his supply durst not be
lessened; although there was in the house but one cow, it
must be killed for the meal of the night, if the means of a
supply could not be otherwise procured.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Succession
to the
kingdom of
Cashel.</div>

<p>At last a deliverer arose. According to the will of Olioll
Olum, King of Munster in the third century&mdash;such is the
theory&mdash;the sovereignty of Cashel, that is of Munster, was to
belong alternately to the races of his two sons, Eoghan Mor
and Cormac Cas. The Eoghanachts and Dal Cais are generally
Anglicised as the Eugenians and Dalcassians; the strength
of the former and much stronger tribe being in Cork,
Limerick, and Kerry&mdash;that of the latter in Clare. The
Eugenian Fergraidh was king in 967, when he was murdered
by his own people. Mahon the Dalcassian then became
king, in compliance with the constitutional theory, but not
without a struggle. Urged on by his brother Brian, he
attacked the Danish settlements up and down the country,
and became master of Cashel, when Ivar, finding his supremacy
threatened, summoned all that would obey him to root
out utterly the whole Dalcassian race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Molloy,
Mahon,
and Brian.</div>

<p>The tribes of Western Munster generally were disposed
to follow Mahon, but Molloy, King of Desmond, and some
others, adhered to the Dane rather than admit the supremacy
of a local rival. A pitched battle took place at Solloghead,
near Tipperary, in which the foreigners and their allies were
totally defeated. Molloy and other chiefs who had taken
the losing side were forced to give hostages to the victor.
Mahon burned Limerick and drove away Ivar, who returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
after a year with a great fleet, and fixed his head-quarters on
Scattery Island, where St. Senanus had so sternly resisted
the blandishments of a female saint.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Murder of
Mahon.
Brian succeeds
him.</div>

<p>For some years Mahon reigned undisputed King of
Munster, but his successes only stimulated the jealousies of
Molloy and the other Eugenian chiefs, who saw their race
reduced to play an inferior part. They accordingly conspired
with Ivar, and Molloy procured the treacherous murder
of Mahon. The crime was useless, for Brian was left, and
he immediately succeeded both to the leadership of his own
tribe and to the kingdom of Munster, Molloy having certainly
forfeited all moral claim to the alternate succession. Brian pursued
the Danes to their strongholds, slew Ivar and his sons, and
carried off the women and the treasure. There was, however,
still a Scandinavian settlement at Limerick, and we
find a grandson of Ivar afterwards in Brian&#8217;s service as one of
the ten Danish stewards whom he employed. He was ambitious,
and he had experience of the skill of such officers in extorting
contributions from unwilling subjects. Molloy and his chief
allies were slain; and Brian, having reduced the Limerick
Danes to insignificance, turned his arm against those of
Waterford, whose territory he ravaged, and whose Celtic
allies, inhabiting the modern county of Waterford, he easily
subdued. Brian was acknowledged as supreme in Munster,
and took security from the principal churches not to give
sanctuary to thieves or rebels. As the consequence of further
expeditions Leinster also became tributary; and thus,
in eight years after his brother&#8217;s death, Brian was admitted
to be supreme in the southern half of Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brian aims
at being
King of
all Ireland.</div>

<p>In his further expeditions, undertaken with a view of
becoming King of all Ireland, the Danes of Waterford sometimes
accompanied Brian; but his progress towards the
desired goal was arrested for a while by a prudent treaty
with Malachi II., head King of Ireland, whom he acknowledged
as undisputed sovereign of the northern half, and by
a revolt of the Leinster men, who were allied with the Danes
of Dublin, the united forces of Brian and Malachi having
overthrown the Leinster Danes at Glenmama, near Dunlavin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Dublin fell an easy prey. The spoils taken are represented as
enormous, and the mention of carbuncles and other precious
stones, of buffalo-horns, goblets, and many-coloured vestures,
betoken some degree of luxury and much commercial activity
among the Danes. It is to be observed that Brian and his
followers, though Christians, had no scruple about making
slaves. His panegyrists simply say that the Danes by their
cruelty and oppression had deserved no better treatment.
Threshing and other rough work was done by the male prisoners.
Menial work, including the severe labour of the
hand-mill, was done by the women. &#8216;There was not,&#8217; we
are told, &#8216;a winnowing sheet from Howth to the furthest
point of Kerry that had not a foreigner in bondage on it,
nor was there a quern without a foreign woman.&#8217; The fairer
and more accomplished of the Danish women of course
underwent the fate of Chryseis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brian and
the Danes,
Gormflaith.</div>

<p>Having in vain sought a refuge with the northern Irish,
Sitric was forced to submit to Brian, who reinstated him at
Dublin as a tributary king. Sitric&#8217;s mother, Gormflaith, or
Kormlada, was sister to Maelmordha, King of Leinster, and
her husband, King Olaf, having been dead many years, she
was free to marry Brian, which she did soon after,
while Brian&#8217;s daughter married Sitric. Wielding thus the
whole force of southern Ireland, Brian called upon Malachi
to acknowledge his supremacy. The King of Ireland sought
aid in vain from his kinsmen, the northern Hy Neill, whose
king Aedh, or Hugh, sarcastically remarked that when his clan
had held the chief kingship they had known how to defend
their own. No help coming from Connaught either, Malachi
was forced to submit to Brian&#8217;s power, and though no
formal cession took place the King of Ireland quietly subsided
into King of Meath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brian, King
of all Ireland,
1002.</div>

<p>Brian was henceforth reckoned as monarch of Ireland.
He invaded Connaught with a flotilla on the Shannon and
an army marching on land, and the chiefs of the western province
were glad to give hostages. The Ulster potentates
falling out among themselves, the north also was easily subdued,
and Brian became the actual lord paramount of Ireland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
After this he made a tour round the island, starting from
the Shannon and marching through Roscommon and over
the Curlew mountains into Sligo. Hugging the coast by
Ballyshannon to Donegal, he crossed Barnesmore Gap into
Tyrone, and then passing the Foyle, near Lifford, he went
through Londonderry, Antrim, Down, and Louth, to the
neighbourhood of Kells. In a previous expedition he had
visited Armagh and laid twenty ounces of gold on the altar.
A fleet, manned by the Danes of Dublin, Limerick, and
Waterford, seems to have circumnavigated Ireland while he
was making the circuit by land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brian&#8217;s
supremacy
a loose one.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Gormflaith&#8217;s
intrigues.</div>

<p>The supremacy of Brian was no doubt an extremely loose
one. He had made no real impression on the northern tribes,
and they only waited a favourable opportunity to cast off the
nominal yet galling yoke. But for about seven years there
seems to have been no serious attempt against him, and he
was able to turn his attention to the building of churches and
bridges. It was during this period that a lone woman is
said to have walked unmolested from the Bloody Foreland to
Glandore with a gold ring at the end of a wand. Peace,
however, there was not; for Brian was engaged in at least
two warlike expeditions to Ulster, and there was a fair amount
of murder and private war among the minor chiefs. Brian
had repudiated Gormflaith, Maelmordha&#8217;s sister and Sitric&#8217;s
mother, and probably not without good reason, for her moral
character was by no means on a par with her beauty and
talents, since she had been married successively to Olaf
Cuaran and to Malachi II., and had been repudiated by both.
&#8216;She was,&#8217; says the Saga, &#8216;the fairest of all women, and best
gifted in everything that was not in her power, but it was
the talk of men that she did all things ill over which she had
any power.&#8217; Brian afterwards married a daughter of the
King of Connaught, and when she died, Gormflaith may have
sought to be reinstated. At all events she was at Kincora
when her brother arrived, bringing with him the tribute of
Leinster. Her taunts, and a quarrel which he had with
Murrough, Brian&#8217;s eldest son, provoked Maelmordha to leave
Kincora in anger, and to raise the standard of revolt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
&#8216;Gormflaith,&#8217; says the Saga, &#8216;was so grim against King
Brian after their parting, that she would gladly have him
dead, and egged on her son Sitric very much to kill him.&#8217;
Sitric readily agreed to Maelmordha&#8217;s proposal, and so did
the northern Hy Neill, who had never been really conquered,
and who at once invaded Meath. After a gallant struggle
against Leinster and Ulster, Malachi was overpowered, and
called upon Brian for help. The King of Ireland, to whom
the men of Connaught remained faithful, accordingly
ravaged the country between his own district and Dublin,
but was obliged to retire from before its walls for want of
provisions.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Alliance of
Sitric and
Gormflaith
against
Brian.</div>

<p>Sitric and Gormflaith made use of the breathing space
allowed them to organise a powerful confederacy against
Brian. Sitric himself went to Sigurd, Earl of Orkney, who,
after many refusals, at last agreed to join, on condition of
receiving the Crown of Ireland and Gormflaith&#8217;s land. &#8216;All
his men,&#8217; says the Saga, &#8216;besought Earl Sigurd not to go
into the war, but it was all to no good.&#8217; Gormflaith was well
pleased at the prospect before her, and advised large preparations
for the inevitable struggle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sitric&#8217;s
allies.
Sigurd.
Brodir.</div>

<p>Sigurd was nominally a Christian, but he reposed his
chief trust in the raven banner which his mother had woven
with mighty spells; and many Scandinavian warriors were
still fanatically attached to Thor and Woden. The Vikings,
Ospak and Brodir, were lying off Man, and to them Sitric
next addressed himself in person. The Norsemen do not
seem to have insisted on youth in their wives, for Brodir was
induced to join by the same promises which had been made
to Sigurd, and Gormflaith&#8217;s first husband had been dead
thirty-three years. &#8216;Brodir,&#8217; says the Icelandic account,
&#8216;had been a Christian man and a mass deacon, but he had
thrown off his faith and become God&#8217;s dastard, and now
worshipped heathen fiends, and was of all men most skilled
in sorcery. He had the coat of mail on which no steel
would bite. He was both tall and strong, and had such long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
locks that he tucked them under his belt. His hair was
black.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Conflict
between
Christianity
and
Paganism.</div>

<p>Ospak, who had leanings towards Christianity, refused to
attack Brian; indeed, he went over to him, and, according
to Norse accounts, was baptized. An immense force was,
however, gradually collected, and Scandinavian contingents
are mentioned from Northumbria, under two Earls, from
Norway, from Orkney and Shetland, Skye and Lewis, from
Cantire, Argyle, and Galloway. Welshmen from Pembrokeshire
and Cornwall, Frenchmen, that is in all probability
French Normans, under Karl and Ebric, and some Flemings
under a knight are also spoken of. Romans even are mentioned,
but this may be mere magniloquence. To oppose
this motley host Brian had the men of Munster, Meath, and
South-eastern Connaught, and the Danes of Limerick and
probably of Waterford. He may have had the numerical superiority,
for Sigurd told his mother, the wise woman, that he
expected to be outnumbered seven to one. The eve of the
battle of Clontarf was signalised, according to the annalists,
by various supernatural occurrences. A messenger from St.
Senanus appeared to the king, and prophesied his death as
the penalty due for violating the sanctuary on Scattery
Island thirty-seven years before. The interests and prejudices
of monastic chroniclers may account for this story, but it is
not so easy to explain the firm belief in pagan deities, in
fairies, in demons, and in satyrs shown by two independent
historians. It is evident that the oracles of heathenism were
not supposed to have been dumb more than 500 years after the
death of Patrick, and 400 after that of Columba. Nor was
there any lack of marvels on the Danish side. Brodir, who had
already been plagued by showers of boiling blood, by supernatural
noises, by deaths among his men, and by ravens with
beaks and claws of iron, &#8216;tried by sorcery how the fight
would go. And the answer ran, that if the fight were on
Good Friday, King Brian would fall but win the day; but if
they fought before, they would all fall that were against him.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Battle of
Clontarf,
1014.</div>

<p>The battle was fought upon the fateful Friday, and Brian
refused to take part in it because the day was holy. He
remained in the rear protected by a ring of soldiers with
their shields locked together. It was observed that the
successive bearers of the raven banner all fell, and Hrafn
the red, who was called by Sigurd to the dangerous duty,
refused, saying, &#8216;Bear thine own devil thyself.&#8217; &#8216;&#8217;Tis fittest
that the beggar should bear the bag,&#8217; answered the Earl, and
put the banner under his cloak. Sigurd fell, and Sitric had
to retire before Ospak. Hrafn the red flew to a river into
which the devils wished to drag him, but a spoken spell
dispersed them. &#8216;Thy dog,&#8217; he cried, &#8216;Apostle Peter, hath
run twice to Rome, and he would run the third time if thou
gavest him leave.&#8217; Of Thorstein we are told that he interrupted
his flight to tie his shoe. Kerthialfad, Brian&#8217;s foster
son, asked him why he lingered at such a critical moment,
and the Northman returned an answer worthy of Sparta&#8217;s
best days&mdash;&#8216;Because I can&#8217;t get home to-night, since I am at
home out in Iceland.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Brian.</div>

<p>In the moment of victory Brian was left behind, and
Brodir, who had lingered for a time in a thicket, broke
through the line of shields and hewed off the king&#8217;s head.
The Viking was taken and disembowelled alive, according to
the Norse account, but the Irish writers say that he fell by
Brian&#8217;s hands. Sigurd being already dead, Gormflaith lost
all chance of a royal husband, and it is only further recorded
of her that she died sixteen years later. Many other chiefs
fell, including Maelmordha, and Murrough, Brian&#8217;s favourite
son, and the fight was followed, as it had been heralded,
by many signs and wonders both in the Celtic and in the
Scandinavian world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Danes
were not
expelled.</div>

<p>The popular delusion that the battle of Clontarf caused the
expulsion of the Danes from Ireland must be pretty well
dissipated by this time. Sitric remained with reserves
within the fortress, and thus saved his kingdom; nor do the
annalists cease to make frequent mention of the foreigners.
But the defeat was great, and may have had considerable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>fluence
in deciding those who were already hovering between
Woden and Jesus. Fourteen years after Clontarf we find
Sitric going to Rome, and his son Olaf was killed in England
when attempting the same pilgrimage. These facts lend
some countenance to the legend that Sitric founded Christ
Church in 1038; for the Roman court well knew how to impress
the rude northern warriors, and to profit in various ways
by their simple faith. We are told that Flosi the Icelander
went to Rome to cleanse himself from the stain of blood-guiltiness,
&#8216;where,&#8217; says the Njal-Saga, &#8216;he gat so great honour
that he took absolution from the Pope himself, and for that
he gave a great sum of money.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">But they
soon accepted
Christianity.</div>

<p>Without actually amalgamating, the Danes seem to have
drawn gradually closer to the native Irish. A royal heir of
Ulster received the name of Ragnal less than half a century
after Clontarf, and in 1121 a bishop seems to have been temporarily
appointed at Dublin by the joint election of Irish
and Danes. But quarrels were frequent even after the Danes
had become fully Christianised; and when the men of Munster
invaded Fingal in 1133, they burned the church of Lusk when
it was full of people and treasures. Nor did fresh invasions
quite cease, for Magnus, King of Norway, made two expeditions
to Ireland, in the latter of which, in 1103, he lost his
life. The separate history of the Irish Ostmen was drawing to
a close, even at the date of the Anglo-Norman invasion; but
they have left indelible traces upon the map of Ireland and
on the traditional lore of her people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Danes
were
traders.</div>

<p>Giraldus informs us that the Scandinavians who settled
at Dublin, Waterford, and Limerick, came under pretence of
peaceful trading. The Irish, he says, were prevented by their
innate sloth from going down to the sea in ships, but were
ready to welcome those who would trade for them, and thus
allowed the fierce strangers to get a strong footing. However
this may be, it is certain that the Irish are deficient in maritime
enterprise, and equally certain that the Northmen had
a constant eye to trade as well as to war and plunder. Unerring
instinct pointed out the best stations, and on the sites
thus chosen the chief cities of Ireland were reared. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Kaupmannaeyjar or merchant isles, probably those now called
the Copelands, may have been a rendezvous for passing vessels.
Arabic coins, of which more than 20,000 pieces from
more than 1,000 different dies are preserved at Stockholm,
have been found in Ireland, and the Irish Northmen certainly
had a coinage of their own, when the native princes had none.
Pieces have been found which were struck by, or at least for,
a Scandinavian king of Dublin as early as the ninth century,
and all coins minted in Ireland up to the Anglo-Norman invasion
were perhaps of similar origin. Many such pieces
have been found in the Isle of Man, and some as far off as
Denmark.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">They were
superior to
the Irish in
peaceful
arts.</div>

<p>The Irish annalists constantly dwell on the superiority of
Norse arms and armour as a reason for their success in war.
Ringmail in particular shows a high degree of manufacturing
skill, and they wore it at Clontarf both in brass and iron,
while none is mentioned in the pompous Irish catalogue of
the arms worn by Brian&#8217;s troops. Nor was this costly harness
worn only by the Scandinavian leaders, for they are said to
have had 1,000 coats of mail in that one battle. Danish
swords which have survived from Brian&#8217;s days are of superior
workmanship to Irish blades of the same date; and the
Northmen had perhaps a superiority in bows also, though on
this point the annalists are less explicit. The turgid verbosity
of these writers makes it doubtful whether the Danes
used poisoned arrows, but no such thing is mentioned in the
Saga.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They built
the first
cities.
Dublin,
Waterford.</div>

<p>The flotillas which Brian maintained on inland waters,
and the sea-going vessels which attended his army in the
North, were all manned by Danes, and a mercantile marine
has in every age been the best nursery of naval power. No
doubt the Irish felt the advantage of having commercial emporiums
on their coast, as other shore-going people profited
by Greek and Ph&oelig;nician colonies. The analogy might easily
be carried further, and Dublin and Waterford might be represented
as standing between the Anglo-Normans and Celts of
Ireland, as Massilia stood between the Romans and Celts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Gaul. It is at all events clear that the Scandinavians built
the first cities and coined the first money in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brian&#8217;s
monarchy
soon fell to
pieces.</div>

<p>High as Brian towers above other mediæval Celts&mdash;one
annalist calls him the Charlemagne of North-western Europe&mdash;it
cannot be said that he laid the foundation of an Irish
monarchy. He lived to be eighty, yet none of his work lasted.
Malachi received the honorary office of chief king, from which
his rival&#8217;s personal prowess had driven him, and the years of his
reign are counted by some annalists without noticing Brian&#8217;s
intervention, as in the modern case of Charles II. Brian was
indeed doubly a usurper, in wresting Munster from the race
of Eoghan, and in wresting Ireland from the race of Nial, in
whom royalty had been vested for centuries. With all his
ceaseless exertions he was little more than a levier of black
mail, who left intact the internal government of weaker
princes. Borumha, or the tribute-taker, if that be really the
meaning of the term, describes his position with sufficient
accuracy. When he died Donnchadh, or Donogh, his son by
Gormflaith, became head of his tribe, and claimed the succession
to the Irish monarchy. The Eugenians repudiated his
claim, alleging that their turn, which had been wrongfully
passed over, had now come to reign in Munster. Not satisfied
with this, their two principal chiefs fell out among themselves.
The Ossorian followed suit, and thus Brian&#8217;s creation
crumbled at once into dust.</p>

<p>More than 150 years elapsed between the battle of Clontarf
and the landing of the first Anglo-Norman, and they
were years of almost constant war and confusion. Had
Ireland been left to herself a prince might in time have arisen
strong enough to establish such a monarchy as Brian failed
to found. The Danes had ceased to be a seriously disturbing
influence, but there is no evidence that any such process of consolidation
was going on, and a feudal system, which had lost
none of its vigour, was at last confronted with a tribal system
which had lost none of its inherent weakness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress of
Christianity.</div>

<p>It is impossible to fix the exact date when Christianity
began to make head against the Irish Ostmen. When
St. Anschar obtained from the Swedes a place for his God in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the northern pantheon, and when Guthrum and his officers
submitted to baptism in Wessex, a foundation had been laid
for a general Scandinavian conversion. But neither Norway
nor the Norwegian colonies in Iceland, Shetland, Orkney, or
the Hebrides, yielded so soon. Irish anchorites spent some
time in Iceland about 795, and when Ingulf and Lief landed
in 870 they found that Irish priests had lately been there,
and had left behind them books, bells, and croziers. The
second batch had probably fled from Ingulf&#8217;s congeners in
Ireland. Olaf Trygvesson, the first Christian king of Norway,
was educated at Athelstane&#8217;s court, and the nominal conversion
of Norway may date from the year of his accession.
Five years later, in 1000, Christianity was established by
law in Iceland. Removed as she was from English or Roman
influences, Ireland remained a stronghold of paganism after
the Danes of England had been generally converted; and the
Irish being on the whole weaker in war, were scarcely in a
position to prove that Woden and Thor had nothing to say
for themselves. Olaf Cuaran was baptized in England. It is
clear that the Irish Danes remained generally pagan throughout
the tenth century, and that the confederacy which failed
at Clontarf had to a great extent been formed against Christianity.
The story of Ospak and Brodir shows that some of
the fiercest Danes were beginning to waver, the question at
issue being the relative power of two deities, rather than the
relative merit of two systems. After Clontarf Woden seems
to have been looked upon as beaten. He had been tried and
found wanting, like Baal on Mount Carmel, and the defeated
party went over to the stronger side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Danish
church of
Dublin.</div>

<p>The connection of the Dublin Danes with their brethren
in England had long been very close, and it was to Canterbury
and Rome rather than to Armagh that they naturally
turned. Sitric and Canute were perhaps in the Eternal City
together; their visit was at least almost simultaneous, and we
cannot doubt that every means were taken to prejudice the
powerful neophyte against the pretensions of St. Patrick&#8217;s successor.
An Ostman named Dunan or Donat is reckoned the first
Bishop of Dublin, and is credited with the foundation of Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Church. A tradition which may be true, but which is not
supported by contemporary evidence, makes Sitric the joint
founder. From an expression in the celebrated letter of the
Dublin burgesses to Archbishop Ralph d&#8217;Eures it may be
fairly inferred that Donat had his succession from Canterbury,
and he certainly corresponded with Lanfranc on the subject
of infant baptism. He was succeeded by Patrick or Gillapatrick,
an Ostman, who was consecrated by Lanfranc in St.
Paul&#8217;s at the instance of Godred Crovan, king of Man, who was
then supreme at Dublin. Godred&#8217;s reign is rather shadowy,
but Lanfranc&#8217;s letter to him has always been considered
genuine, and it addresses him as king not only of Dublin, but
of Ireland. Lanfranc also wrote to Tirlogh, who had acquired
the supreme kingship, like his father, Brian Borumha. It is
not unlikely that the curious poem which represents St.
Patrick as blessing Dublin and its Danish inhabitants, and
cursing the Hy Neill, was forged at this time, partly in the
Munster interest and partly to prove that Dublin was not
subject to Armagh.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dublin
acknowledges
Canterbury
and
repudiates
Armagh.</div>

<p>In his letters Lanfranc insists much upon Catholic unity.
According to modern ideas, the heaviest of the charges which
he brings against the Irish Church is the levity with which
they regarded the marriage tie. It appears that men even
exchanged wives. Bishop Patrick promised ecclesiastical
fealty to the Archbishop of Canterbury, as Primate of the
British Isles. Lanfranc had obeyed the order of his old
pupil Alexander II., who was prompted by the deacon Hildebrand,
and had gone to Rome to receive his pall. But in his
dealings with Dublin he acted independently, and he was
ready to give advice to Irish prelates, though without claiming
direct jurisdiction over them. In doctrinal matters he
was an ally of Rome. Himself an Italian, he espoused the
dogma of transubstantiation in opposition to the Irishman
Erigena, and the Frenchman Berengarius; and on the great
question of clerical celibacy he was a follower, though not an
extreme one, of the uncompromising Hildebrand. The ever-watchful
Roman Court probably espied the germ of a Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
patriarchate, and was thus moved to annex Armagh as a
counterpoise to the dangerous primacy claimed under a
grant of Gregory the Great by the successors of Augustine.
Gregory VII., in addressing the kings, nobles, and prelates
of Ireland, took care to claim absolute sovereignty by divine
right; and here he ran little risk of such a rebuff as William
the Conqueror administered.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lanfranc
and Anselm.</div>

<p>Patrick&#8217;s successor was Donat O&#8217;Haingly, an Irishman,
but a Benedictine monk of Canterbury, who was consecrated
by Lanfranc, to whom he had been recommended by King
Tirlogh. He was succeeded by his nephew Samuel, a Benedictine
of St. Albans, who was consecrated by Anselm. That
great archbishop was not altogether pleased with his Irish
brother, whom he chid for alienating vestments bestowed on
the Church of Dublin by Lanfranc, and for having the cross
borne before him, although he had never received the pall. A
further element of confusion was introduced, probably in
1118, by the Irish synod of Rathbreasil, which declared
Dublin to be in the diocese of Glendalough; and it seems
that the Irish inhabitants submitted, while those of Danish
origin refused to do so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ralph of
Canterbury
consecrates
Gregory,
who receives
the
pall from
Pope
Eugenius.</div>

<p>On the death of Bishop Samuel O&#8217;Haingly, the Irish
annals inform us that &#8216;Cellach, comarb of Patrick, assumed
the bishopric of Ath-cliath,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> by the choice of foreigners and
Gaeidhil.&#8217; If there be any truth in this it was a bold stroke
on the part of Armagh to exercise jurisdiction in Dublin, and
was probably the act of the Irish as opposed to the Danish
party. In the same year, or the next, the burgesses and
clergy of Dublin wrote to Ralph of Canterbury, begging him
to consecrate their nominee Gregory. They reminded him that
their bishops originally derived their dignity from his predecessors,
and that the bishops of Ireland were very jealous of
them; and especially he of Armagh, because they preferred
the rule of Canterbury. Ralph consecrated Gregory, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
governed the see for forty years. To his lot it fell to receive
the pall sent by Pope Eugenius, who was too politic to insist
on a visit to Rome. For the moment it was enough to assert
the necessity of the pallium and its papal origin. The legate
Paparo ignored the pretensions of the bishop whose church
in the mountains had the name of city, and divided the diocese
into two parts: the bishop with the Cantuarian succession
being made Metropolitan, and the Irishman at Glendalough
being reduced to the position of a suffragan. St. Lawrence
O&#8217;Toole, who was the second Archbishop of Dublin, derived
his succession from Armagh, and the Scandinavian Church of
Dublin ceases to have a separate history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">See of
Waterford.</div>

<p>Of far less importance than that of Dublin, the early
history of the see of Waterford is proportionately obscure.
Malchus, a Benedictine of Winchester, who seems to have
been the first bishop elected by the Ostmen, was consecrated
by Anselm; to whom he promised canonical obedience, and
with whom he corresponded. It seems likely that he was
afterwards translated to Lismore, or he may have held both
sees together, as they were held in after years. It is probable
that the great Malachi of Armagh studied under him.
Maelisa O&#8217;Hanmire appears next in succession, but we know
nothing of him. He may have represented a reaction against
the dominion of Canterbury. The next name preserved is
that of Tosti, who was, of course, a Dane, and who assisted
in the establishment of the papal or Eugenian constitution.
Tosti&#8217;s successor, Augustine O&#8217;Sealbhaigh, was practically
appointed by Henry II., and he attended the Lateran Council
in 1179.</p>

<div class="sidenote">See of
Limerick.
Gillebert.</div>

<p>The tradition which connects St. Patrick with Limerick
is of the vaguest kind: practically, the first recorded bishop
is Gillebert. He was an Irishman. Cellach of Armagh acted
with the Bishop of Limerick on this occasion; but while
both were anxious to parcel out Ireland into dioceses, neither
ventured to interfere with Dublin, which was under the
powerful patronage of Canterbury. Gillebert resigned both
the legatine authority and his own bishopric before his
death, which took place in or about 1145. His successor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Patrick, having been elected by the Ostmen, was consecrated
in England by Theobald, Archbishop of Canterbury, to whom
he promised canonical obedience. The three following bishops,
Harold, Turgeis, and Brictius, who may be Elbric or Eric,
were doubtless all Ostmen. Very little is known of them,
except that the last named attended the Lateran Council in
1179 and 1180.</p>

<div class="sidenote">See of Cork.</div>

<p>Cork was often plundered by the Northmen, and they
settled there permanently early in the eleventh century. But
they found themselves confronted by a strong monastic
organisation, under the successor of St. Finbar, whereas at
Dublin, Waterford, and Limerick the field had been clear.
Around the abbey a native town had sprung up, which was
strong enough to maintain itself by the side of the Scandinavian
garrison. Once, with the help of a force from Carbery,
they defeated a confederacy of Danes belonging to Cork,
Waterford, and Wexford. The Ostmen were in quiet possession
of Cork for a period long preceding the Anglo-Norman
invasion, but they were probably content to take their
Christianity from their neighbours, for we do not find that
any bishop of this see sought consecration at Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE REIGN OF HENRY II.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">England
lays claim
to Ireland,
1155.</div>

<p>The claims of the Kings of England to Ireland were very
vague. They sometimes acted as patrons of the Irish Ostmen,
who were not unwilling to follow the example of their
Northumbrian kinsmen, but they performed no real function
of sovereignty. William the Conqueror and his sons had
not time to attend to Ireland, and this applies in an even
greater degree to Stephen. Henry II. ascended an undisputed
throne, and in the first year of his reign turned his
thoughts to the fertile island of the West. Being badly in
want of a title, he sent John of Salisbury to Rome for leave
to conquer Ireland, to root up the saplings of vice there, and
to bring the wild Irish into the way of the true faith. The
Pope was Nicholas Breakspeare, known in history as Adrian
IV., the only Englishman who ever filled the papal chair.
The popes were usually ready to grant boons to kings, if by
so doing they could extend their own power, and an English
pope must have felt a double pride in conferring favours on a
king of England. The mission of John of Salisbury was
successful. He brought back the Bull <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laudabiliter</i> and a
gold ring containing a very fine emerald, intended to be
used in Henry&#8217;s investiture. Empress Maude objected to an
Irish expedition, and nothing was done until long after
Adrian&#8217;s death. Henry took the precaution of having the
grant confirmed by Alexander III., and there is ample evidence
that he annexed Ireland with the entire approbation
of that Pope.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Adrian IV

<p>Irish scholars, torn asunder by their love of Rome and
their love of Ireland, formerly attempted to prove that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Adrian&#8217;s bull was not genuine; but its authenticity is no
longer disputed. The momentous document runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adrian&#8217;s
bull.</div>

<p>&#8216;Hadrian the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his very dear son in Christ, the illustrious King of the
English, health and apostolic benediction:</p>

<p>&#8216;Your magnificence praiseworthily and profitably takes
thought how to increase a glorious name on earth and how
to lay up a reward of everlasting happiness in heaven, while
you are intent, like a Catholic prince, on enlarging the
bounds of the Church, on declaring the truth to unlearned
and rude peoples, and on uprooting the seedlings of vice from
the Lord&#8217;s field. The better to attain that end you have
asked counsel and favour of the apostolic see. In which
action we are sure that, with God&#8217;s help, you will make happy
progress in proportion to the high design and great discretion
of your proceedings, inasmuch as undertakings which grow
out of ardour for the faith and love of religion are accustomed
always to have a good end and upshot. There is no
doubt and your nobility acknowledges that Ireland, and all
islands upon which Christ the sun of justice has shone, and
which have received the teachings of the Christian faith,
rightfully belong to the blessed Peter and the most holy
Roman Church. We have, therefore, the more willingly
made a faithful plantation among them, and inserted a bud
pleasing to God, in that we foresee that it will require a
careful internal watch at our hands. However, you have
signified to us, my dear son in Christ, that you wish to enter
the island of Ireland, in order to reduce that people to law,
and to uproot the seedlings of vice there, and to make a
yearly payment of a denarius to the blessed Peter out of
each house, and to preserve the rights of the churches of
that land whole and undiminished.</p>

<p>&#8216;We, therefore, seconding your pious and laudable desire
with suitable favour, and giving a kindly assent to your petition,
do hold it for a thing good and acceptable that you
should enter that island for the extension of the Church&#8217;s
borders, for the correction of manners, for the propagation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of virtue, and for increase of the Christian religion; and
that you should perform that which you intend for the
honour of God and for the salvation of that land; and let
the people of that land receive you honourably and venerate
you as their lord; the ecclesiastical law remaining whole
and untouched, and an annual payment of one denarius
being reserved to the blessed Peter and to the most holy
Roman Church. But if you shall complete the work which
you have conceived in your mind, study to mould that race
to good morals, and exert yourself personally and by such of
your agents as you shall find fit in faith, word, and living,
to honour the Church there, and to plant and increase the
Christian faith, and strive to ordain what is for the honour
of God and the safety of souls in such a manner that you
may deserve at God&#8217;s hands a heap of everlasting treasure,
and on earth gain a glorious name for ages yet to come.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The papal
title.</div>

<p>The right of the Pope to dispose of islands rested upon
the donation of Constantine, which is now admitted to be
as certainly spurious as Adrian&#8217;s bull is certainly genuine.
Adrian may have believed the donation authentic, but in
any case, as Irish scholars point out, Constantine could not
give what he had never possessed. It is true that Ireland
never really formed part of the Roman Empire, but so strong
was the idea of an &oelig;cumenical sovereignty that Celtic lawyers
imagined a state of things in which Ireland would be tributary
to the King of the Romans. This was a mere fiction,
but it was one of which Rome would readily take advantage,
and the Pope who insisted so sturdily on Barbarossa holding
his stirrup was not the one in whose hands any available
weapon would be allowed to rust.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry II.
finds a pretext
for interference.</div>

<p>Henry II. was the most powerful prince in Europe, and
sooner or later he was almost sure to have a reason for interfering
in Ireland. The opportunity was at last afforded by
Dermod MacMurrough, King of Leinster, who aspired to
reign over all Ireland with the help of Anglo-Norman arms.
As early as 1152 Dervorgil O&#8217;Melaghlin, wife of Tiernan
O&#8217;Rourke, Prince of Brefny, being ill-treated by her husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
left him, and placed herself, her cattle, and her furniture
under the protection of Dermod. Dervorgil was forty-four
and Dermod sixty-two, so that the affair, in spite of a
beautiful poem on the subject, was not what would be commonly
called romantic. Yet Cleopatra was thirty-nine, when
Antonius, at the age of fifty-three, refused to survive her.
O&#8217;Rourke felt the insult and the loss of the lady, or, at least,
of her property, and appealed to Tirlogh O&#8217;Connor, King of
Connaught and titular King of Ireland. Dermod was compelled
to abandon Dervorgil, who survived her husband eleven
years, and died as late as 1193, during a pilgrimage to
Mellifont Abbey. On the death of Tirlogh O&#8217;Connor his
son Roderic became a candidate for the chief sovereignty,
but Dermod espoused the cause of the O&#8217;Neill candidate,
who was successful. The flight or abduction of Dervorgil
was certainly not the proximate cause of the Norman invasion,
but by placing Dermod in permanent opposition to
O&#8217;Connor and O&#8217;Rourke, it probably contributed to bring it
about.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dermod
MacMurrough.</div>

<p>In 1166 Dermod, who had made himself odious by his
tyranny, was expelled from Leinster by O&#8217;Connor and
O&#8217;Rourke, who demolished his stronghold at Ferns, and
transferred his kingship to the next-of-kin. The clergy
appear to have been generally favourable to Dermod; and as
Adrian&#8217;s bull, even if not published, could hardly be a secret,
it may have been their advice which induced him to go to
Henry II. Dermod, though seventy-seven years old, was
still active and enterprising, and he sought the king in
Aquitaine or Guienne. Henry was too busy to think of
going to Ireland himself, but he gave the suppliant a kind
of letter of marque in the following terms:&mdash;&#8216;Henry, King
of England, Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and Count
of Anjou, to all his faithful English, Norman, Welsh, and
Scots, and to all nations subject to his jurisdiction, greeting:
When these present letters reach you you will know that
we have received into the bosom of our grace and favour
Dermod, prince of the Leinstermen. If anyone, therefore,
within the bounds of our power wishes to help his restoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
as our man and liege subject, let him know that he has our
licence and favour for the purpose.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dermod
seeks allies
in England.</div>

<p>Thus armed, Dermod returned to Bristol, which was much
frequented by ships from Leinster, and he appears to have
been supplied with money by his partisans there. His promise
of gold and land at first attracted little attention, but
after two or three weeks he was visited by Richard Fitz-Gilbert
de Clare, Earl of Chepstow. Earl Richard, whose
father had lost most of his lands, lent a favourable ear to
Dermod, and undertook to bring an army to Ireland in the
spring of 1169. The Irishman promised to give him his
daughter Eva, his only legitimate child. According to Norman
law Eva would bring the kingdom of Leinster to her husband
and children. According to Celtic law the lands belonged
to the tribe, and the royal dignity was elective. In this
singular contract between MacMurrough and Fitz-Gilbert,
we have the key to most of the problems which have made
Ireland the despair of statesmen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earl
Richard
and his
friends.</div>

<p>Dermod, however, did not rest his hopes of success upon
Earl Richard alone. He went to St. David&#8217;s, so as to be as
near Ireland as possible, and made friends with the bishop,
who had two brothers admirably suited for the work in hand.
Nesta, the beautiful daughter of Rice ap Tudor, Prince of
South Wales, is reported to have been the mistress of Henry
I., and to have had two sons by him. The younger of these
had also two sons, the Robert and Meiler Fitz-Henry who
played a prominent part in the conquest of Ireland. Nesta
afterwards married Gerald of Windsor, by whom she had
three sons and one or two daughters, and from one or other
of her children all the Fitzgeralds, Barrys, Carews, and
Cogans are descended. After the death of Gerald, Nesta
married Stephen, the castellan of Abertivy, and by him had
one son, the famous Robert Fitz-Stephen. Giraldus, who
must have known, twice states expressly that Fitz-Stephen
had no legitimate child. The historian himself was Nesta&#8217;s
grandson, through her daughter Angareta, who married
William de Barry. Robert Fitz-Stephen, and his half-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>brother,
Maurice Fitzgerald, listened readily to MacMurrough,
who promised them Wexford and two cantreds of
land, if they would help him conquer Leinster.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitz-Stephen
and others

1169.</div>

<p>Robert Fitz-Stephen was a desperate man. Betrayed by
his own followers, he had suffered three years&#8217; imprisonment
among the Welsh, had been released on promising to serve
Rice Fitz-Griffith against Henry II., and had agreed to hold
Abertivy for the Cambrian and not for the Angevin. Dermod
now offered him a loophole to escape from, and he agreed to
accept his offers and to invade Ireland. His half-brother,
Maurice Fitzgerald, consented to accompany him. Dermod
then slipped over to Ireland and sought a refuge among the
clergy of Ferns, who entertained him, as the Archdeacon of
St. David&#8217;s carefully notes, to the best of their small ability.
It was in the winter of 1168 that MacMurrough returned
to Ireland, and in May 1169 Fitz-Stephen and his brother
followed with thirty knights of their own kinfolk, sixty men-at-arms,
and 300 archers, picked, as Giraldus says, from
among the youth of Wales. Three ships carried them all,
and they landed safely in Bannow Bay, a shallow inlet which
they had probably mistaken either for Waterford or Wexford.
The brothers were accompanied by Hervey de Montmorency,
who was sent by his nephew, Earl Richard, rather as a spy
than as a soldier. On the following day Maurice de Prendergast,
whose name still lives at Haverfordwest, brought
ten knights and a number of archers from Milford, and
landed not far from the same place. As soon as Dermod
heard of the adventurers&#8217; arrival he sent his son Donald with
500 men to welcome them, and soon followed himself.
Donald, surnamed Kavanagh, from having been fostered at
Kilcavan, was illegitimate; but that was a matter little considered
among the old Irish, and he became the ancestor of
those Kavanaghs or MacMurroughs who afterwards claimed
the kingship of Leinster and even of Ireland, and who baffled
Richard II. and his great army.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">They win
Wexford.</div>

<p>After a smart conflict Fitz-Stephen and MacMurrough
mastered Wexford, which was a Danish town. The Irishman&#8217;s
readiness to grant Wexford to the adventurers was very
probably caused by the fact that the town had never been
really in his power. Perhaps he hoped to get rid of the
Normans when he had used them to subdue his enemies. It
was evident that Fitz-Stephen and his company could do
little more than hold Wexford. If Leinster was to be conquered
it could only be by a much larger force. Nevertheless,
Fitz-Stephen decided to advance into the country, and was
joined by the Wexford Danes, who probably were not slow
to learn that the Normans were their kinsmen. With a
heterogeneous army of 3,000 men, Dermod and his allies
marched towards Ossory. There was a battle in open ground
with the Ossorians, and the mail-clad stranger had an easy
victory. Among the slain was a personal enemy of Dermod,
and we are told that that savage, &#8216;lifting up the dead man&#8217;s
head by hair and ears, cruelly and inhumanly tore away the
nostrils and lips with his teeth.&#8217; In the meantime King
Roderic had set his army in motion against the invaders, and
easily penetrated to the neighbourhood of Ferns. The monastery
was surrounded by woods and bogs, and Fitz-Stephen,
who was an adept in Welsh warfare, taught the Leinstermen
how to make it impregnable with ditches and abattis.
Neither party were very anxious to fight, and Dermod made
a treaty with Roderic, in which he acknowledged him as chief
king, in consideration of being allowed to enjoy Leinster in
peace. Giraldus says there was a secret understanding that
the adventurers should be sent home as soon as they had
pacified Leinster, and that no reinforcements should be
brought over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earl
Richard
hesitates.
His friends

<p>Whatever understanding he might have with O&#8217;Connor,
Dermod did not soon abandon the hope of more help from
Wales. &#8216;We have,&#8217; he wrote to Earl Richard, &#8216;observed the
storks and swallows; the summer birds have come, and with
this west wind have returned. Neither Favonius nor Eurus
has brought us your much-desired and long-expected presence.&#8217;
The Earl had waited for the return of Hervey de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Montmorency, and when he brought a favourable report it
was still necessary to make at least some show of consulting
Henry II. The King had forbidden him to go to Ireland, but
he now sought an audience and begged either the restoration
of his estates or leave to carve out a new one for himself.
Henry gave an ambiguous answer, which the Earl chose to
interpret in his own favour. In May 1170 he sent out
Hervey again, accompanied by Raymond Fitzgerald, called
Le Gros, a creature of Fitz-Stephen and Maurice, with
twenty knights and seventy archers. Raymond landed at
the south-eastern angle of the modern county of Kilkenny,
just at the point where the united Nore and Barrow flow into
the Suir. He intrenched himself at once, and was soon
attacked by the Waterford Danes. If Giraldus is to be
believed, a panic seized the assailants, of whom 500 were
killed, and many taken. Among Raymond&#8217;s followers
was a leper named William Ferrand, who performed prodigies
of valour, &#8216;choosing rather to die gloriously than to
endure the burden of his disease.&#8217; A question arose as to the
disposal of the prisoners. Raymond was for sparing, Hervey
for slaying. &#8216;The opinion of the latter,&#8217; says Giraldus, &#8216;prevailed;
the citizens were condemned, and, their limbs having
been broken, they were cast headlong into the sea.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earl

lands, 1170.</div>

<p>Earl Richard landed near Waterford on August 23, 1170.
The city was taken soon afterwards, and Reginald&#8217;s tower is
particularly mentioned as forming part of the defences. That
tower still stands with one of Cromwell&#8217;s cannon balls sticking
in the wall&mdash;a monument of three distinct invaders: the
Pagan Northman, the Catholic Anglo-Norman, and the Puritan
Englishman. &#8216;Earl Strongbow,&#8217; say the Lough Cé annalists
with pathetic brevity, &#8216;came into Erin to Dermod MacMurrough
to avenge his expulsion by Roderic, son of Tirlogh
O&#8217;Connor; and Dermod gave him his own daughter
and a part of his patrimony; and Saxon foreigners have been
in Erin since then.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The adventurers
take
Dublin.</div>

<p>Waterford and Wexford having fallen, and his daughter
Eva having been married to Earl Richard, Dermod, who now
aspired to the crown of all Ireland, felt himself strong enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
to attack Dublin. The Earl had brought 200 knights and
1,000 other soldiers, so that the allied force was a considerable
one. MacMurrough led the army safely through the Wicklow
mountains, which were the scene of more than one disaster
to Elizabeth&#8217;s officers. Dermod&#8217;s auxiliaries had been trained
in Wales; and probably understood mountain warfare much
better than those who had served in the Netherlands, or even
on the Scottish border. Lawrence O&#8217;Toole, Archbishop of
Dublin, a man revered both by Danes and Irishmen, attempted
to make peace between the citizens and their assailants; but
Raymond and Milo de Cogan, while their elders parleyed, led
a chosen band to the assault. They soon mastered the place;
and Hasculph, with a number of followers and some treasure,
escaped to the Orkneys, whence he went to Norway for help.
Meath, which for some unexplained reason was in O&#8217;Rourke&#8217;s
possession, was next invaded, and Roderic then wrote to
upbraid Dermod with having broken his oath by interfering
outside the bounds of Leinster. MacMurrough shortly answered
that he meant to be monarch of Ireland, and Roderic
then killed his son, who was with him as a hostage. The
clergy of Armagh assembled in their synod saw or suspected
that the invasion was different from all former invasions.
They agreed that Ireland had brought a curse on herself by
keeping Englishmen in slavery, and they ordered the liberation
of all such bondsmen. Henry II. also saw that something
extraordinary had happened. He had no fancy for
having an independent Norman principality within sight of
Snowdon, and he ordered the adventurers to return, strictly
forbidding all communication with them in the meantime.
Fitz-Gilbert wrote to the King, who was in Aquitaine, protesting
that he believed he had the royal licence for what he
had done, and that he was ready to be his vassal for all he
might gain in Ireland. Raymond was sent with the letter,
but Henry kept him a long time in suspense.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Danes
vainly
attempt to
retake
Dublin.</div>

<p>At Whitsuntide, 1171, while Earl Richard was waiting
for the King&#8217;s answer, Hasculph returned with sixty ships,
containing a well-armed force, under a berserker called John
the Mad. Milo de Cogan had been left governor of Dublin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and he and his brother Richard succeeded after a short fight
in routing their assailants. John the Mad was killed, and
Hasculph taken while trying to escape across the slob to his
ships. The prisoner annoying him by threats of another and
more formidable attempt, Milo ordered him to be beheaded.
He had, however, spoken truth, for Godred, King of Man, soon
appeared with thirty ships, and blocked the mouth of the
Liffey, while Roderic, having collected a great army from
all parts of Ireland, except the extreme north and south,
besieged the city by land. The Earl and his followers being
thus shut up in Dublin, Dermod&#8217;s local enemies besieged
Fitz-Stephen in the castle which he had built at Wexford.
No help, as the Irish well knew, could be expected from
England while Henry II. frowned, and the Normans at
Dublin resolved on a great effort to relieve Fitz-Stephen. A
sally was arranged, and Roderic&#8217;s army was dispersed. The
Irish had trusted entirely to their numbers, and kept no
watch and no order. Such stores of provisions fell into the
victors&#8217; hands that there was no need to victual Dublin
for a year afterwards. Fitz-Stephen, however, was not
relieved. By force or stratagem, Giraldus says it was by
perjury, the Wexford people obtained possession of his
person, and killed or captured his men. Hearing of the
disaster at Dublin, the victors burned their town and withdrew
with their prisoners to an island in the middle of the
harbour. Earl Richard arrived too late for his immediate
purpose, and continued his journey to Waterford, whence he
made his way to the King, whom he met near Gloucester.
Henry was at first obdurate, but it was finally agreed that
Dublin and all other port towns, with the lands adjoining,
should be handed over to the King, and that the Earl and his
heirs should hold all their other conquests of him and his
heirs. While preparations were being made for a royal
expedition, O&#8217;Rourke once more attacked Dublin, but the
Cogans again surprised the Irish camp, and the city was
never again seriously threatened by the natives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry II.
lands in
Ireland,
1171.</div>

<p>The last attack on Dublin was about September 1, 1171, and
on October 16 the King sailed from Milford Haven with 400<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
ships, containing 4,000 men, of whom 400 or 500 were knights.
He landed next day at Crook, on the right bank of the Suir,
some miles below Waterford, which he entered on the 18th.
The Wexford men saw that the game was up, and brought
Fitz-Stephen to the King, expecting thanks for surrendering
the man who had dared to make war without the royal licence.
Henry spoke sharply to the prisoner, and ordered him to be
kept safely in Reginald&#8217;s tower. Dermod MacCarthy, chief
of Desmond and Cork, did homage at Waterford. Thence
Henry went to Lismore, where he stayed two days. From
Lismore he went to Cashel, where Donald O&#8217;Brien, chief of
Thomond and Limerick, followed MacCarthy&#8217;s example. The
minor chiefs of Munster also made their submission, the only
one mentioned by Giraldus being O&#8217;Phelan, who ruled a great
part of the county of Waterford. Dermod&#8217;s old antagonist,
Donald of Ossory, also did homage. Henry placed governors
both in Cork and Limerick, but it is not clear that he visited
either of those cities. He then returned along the Suir to
Waterford, where he took Fitz-Stephen into favour, and
restored Wexford to him. During this progress the King
selected three sites for fortresses, which were afterwards built
by his son John&mdash;Lismore on the Blackwater, and Ardfinnan
and Tibraghny on the Suir. The first and last were intended
to command the upper tidal waters of the Blackwater and
Suir; Ardfinnan secured a passage from the southern sea-board
into Central Ireland, and Cromwell recognised its importance
nearly five hundred years afterwards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry II.
winters at
Dublin.</div>

<p>Leaving a governor in Waterford, Henry then led the
bulk of his army to Dublin, where he received the submissions
of O&#8217;Rourke and of the chiefs of Leinster and Uriel.
Hugo de Lacy and William Fitz-Adelm were sent to meet
Roderic at the Shannon, and the monarch of Ireland acknowledged
himself a tributary and vassal of the King of England.
Ulster still held out; for the submission of the nominal head
king can in no way be held to bind the chiefs, much less the
people, of his own province, and certainly not those of all
Ireland. Giraldus does not venture to advance any such
theory, and yet Hooker, who translated his work in Elizabeth&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
time, coolly interpolates the statement that &#8216;by him and his
submission all the residue of the whole land became the
King&#8217;s subjects, and submitted themselves.&#8217; The synod
which met at Cashel under the legate&#8217;s presidency did what
was possible for the Church to do in strengthening Henry&#8217;s
pretensions. The King held a court at Dublin during the
winter of 1171 and 1172. His temporary palace, erected
outside the walls on the ground now occupied by the southern
side of Dame Street, was built of polished wicker-work, after
the manner of the country. Here he kept Christmas in
state, and invited the Irish chiefs to share his feast. They
admired the King&#8217;s grandeur, and were by him persuaded to
eat crane&#8217;s flesh, which the Normans thought a delicacy, but
which the Irish had hitherto loathed. The winter was so
stormy that there was scarcely any communication with
England, and Henry&#8217;s pleasure in his new acquisition must
have been darkened by the sense of impending retribution for
the recent murder of Becket.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry&#8217;s
warlike
preparations.
He
distrusts
the adventurers.</div>

<p>From the preparation which he made for the invasion of
Ireland, it seems clear that the King profoundly distrusted the
adventurers who had insisted on winning him a new realm.
Vast stores of provisions, a great number of hand-mills,
artisans for building bridges, horses, and tools for building or
trenching, might indeed have been required for a war against
the natives. But the Irish had no fortresses, and wooden
castles, of which we also read, can only have been intended
for attacking the port-towns which Earl Richard had promised
to give the King, and which were already in Norman
hands. Henry saw enough of Ireland to know that he had
really nothing to fear from the adventurers. Dermod MacMurrough
was dead before his arrival, and it was clear that
Earl Richard would have enough to do in maintaining his
wife&#8217;s monstrous claim without doing anything to offend his
own sovereign.</p>

<p>When, therefore, shortly before Easter, 1172, news came
from Aquitaine and Normandy that the legates were on their
way to inquire into the Canterbury tragedy, Henry lost no
time in appointing Hugo de Lacy his representative at Dublin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and in arranging for the safe keeping of Waterford and
Wexford. He sailed from the latter port on Easter Monday
1172, having been in Ireland exactly six months.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry
leaves Ireland.
He
grants
Meath to
De Lacy.</div>

<p>Before leaving the country Henry granted to Hugo de
Lacy all the territory of Meath, by the service of fifty knights.
This included Westmeath, with parts of King&#8217;s County and
Longford, and was about 800,000 acres in extent. De Lacy,
to whom Hoveden gives the title of justiciar, must be considered
as the first Viceroy of Ireland, and he lost no time
in advancing a claim which, if successful, would make him
one of the most important vassals of the Crown. Tiernan
O&#8217;Rourke, the one-eyed King of Meath, consented to meet
the Pretender at the Hill of Ward. The conference ended in
a quarrel, and O&#8217;Rourke was killed. Giraldus charges treason
upon the Irishman, and the Irish annalists charge it upon the
Norman. The important point is that De Lacy was able to
make head against the Irish, and that a powerful Norman
colony was established by him in the fertile central tract of
Ireland. Earl Richard was rather less successfully engaged
in fighting for Leinster, which Henry had granted him by
the service of one hundred knights, when he was summoned
to Normandy, where he did such good service that the King
made him Viceroy in De Lacy&#8217;s room. This was in 1173.
It was in the next year, or perhaps in 1175, that Henry had
the bulls or privileges of Adrian IV. and Alexander III. promulgated
in Ireland. We can hardly suppose that they were
previously unknown to the clergy, who so manifestly favoured
the Anglo-Normans all through. Perhaps the King&#8217;s main
object in publishing them at this time was to make his own
peace with Rome, by ostentatiously announcing that he held
Ireland of the tiara, and not in right of his own sword.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties
of the adventurers.</div>

<p>When Earl Richard returned to Ireland he found that
he had lost ground. The Irish were beginning to recover
confidence, and Hervey and Raymond were quarrelling
bitterly. The latter was the favourite of the soldiers,
who insisted on having him for leader, and he gained some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
successes over the Danes of Cork and over the MacCarthys.
Believing himself worthy of the highest rewards, Raymond
asked for the Constableship of Leinster, and for the hand of
Basilia, the earl&#8217;s sister. The new Viceroy was disinclined
to grant these terms, and Raymond, whose father had just
died, went over to Wales to look after his old inheritance.
Hervey thus became second in command, and planned a
campaign in concert with the Dublin garrison. Earl Richard
accompanied him to Cashel, but the intended junction was
not effected. Donald O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s homage to Henry II. did
not prevent him from hindering his representative, and at
Thurles he surprised and totally defeated the Dublin division.
No less than 400 Danes are said by Giraldus to have fallen,
which shows that a portion of that nation had accepted the
alliance of their Teutonic kindred. The O&#8217;Briens were aided
by a large contingent from Connaught, but it does not
appear that Roderic was himself present. The immediate
result of this defeat was the recall of Raymond and his marriage
to Basilia. He easily put down a partial revolt of the
Waterford and Wexford Danes; and, finding himself indispensable,
remained at Wexford until his bride was brought
to him. The honeymoon was scarcely begun when news
came that Roderic was wasting Meath, and had penetrated
nearly to Dublin. Raymond hastened thither, and the Connaught
men retired before him. Castles, according to Giraldus,
were already built at Trim and Duleek; but they had
not proved strong enough to resist Roderic, and Raymond&#8217;s first
care was to restore and strengthen them. The adventurers,
most of whom were already nearly related, were still more
closely united by the marriage of Hervey to Raymond&#8217;s sister
Nesta, and of Earl Richard&#8217;s daughter Aline to William Fitzgerald.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of

1176.</div>

<p>Donald O&#8217;Brien was not left long to enjoy his victory.
Limerick was taken by a sudden onslaught under Raymond,
and the bounds of the colony were advanced as far as they
had yet been. Raymond still lingered on the Shannon,
where he received a loving letter from his wife, in which she
informed him &#8216;that the great molar tooth, which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
hurting her so much, had now fallen out.&#8217; He could not
read, but his chaplain secretly imparted the contents of the
paper, and he guessed that Basilia alluded to the death of
her brother, who had been for some time ill. He hurried to
Dublin, and found that Earl Richard was indeed dead.
Deprived of their leader, and probably hard pressed by the
Irish, the Normans thought it prudent to evacuate Limerick.
It was surrendered to Donald O&#8217;Brien, who set fire to the
city in four places as soon as they were gone. When the King
heard of this he remarked that the abandonment of Limerick
was the only wise thing that had been done concerning it.
The Normans chose Raymond their governor in Earl Richard&#8217;s
room; but he was quickly superseded by William Fitz-Adelm
de Burgh, whom Henry sent over as Viceroy with large
powers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fitz-Adelm
depresses
the adventurers.</div>

<p>According to Giraldus, the new governor did all in his
power to depress the adventurers of Nesta&#8217;s stock. Raymond
came to meet him with a chosen band of his relations
and friends finely mounted and armed. Instead of being
conciliated, the Viceroy muttered to his suite, &#8216;I will soon
cut short this pride and disperse these shields.&#8217; According
to the same authority, he took advantage of the death of
Maurice Fitzgerald to defraud that leader&#8217;s children. Giraldus
is partial, but it is easy to see that official governors were
from the first jealous of the local magnates, and were disposed
to engross all influence. Fitz-Adelm did little or
nothing to increase the Norman power in Ireland, and he
was recalled in 1177.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treaty
between
Henry II.
and Roderic
O&#8217;Connor.</div>

<p>In October 1175, not long before the death of Earl
Richard, Henry II. made a treaty with Roderic O&#8217;Connor,
which must be understood as a kind of declaration of policy.
The commissaries who attended at Windsor on Roderic&#8217;s part
were Catholicus, or Keyly O&#8217;Duffy, Archbishop of Tuam, the
Abbot of Ardfert, and the King of Connaught&#8217;s Brehon,
whom Giraldus calls his Chancellor. The Archbishop of
Dublin, St. Lawrence O&#8217;Toole, was among the witnesses to
the instrument by which Henry granted &#8216;to his liege man
Roderic, King of Connaught, as long as he should serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
faithfully, to be King under him, ready to serve him as his
man, and to hold his land well and peacefully, as he held it
before the King of England&#8217;s entry into Ireland, paying him
tribute.&#8217; Should he be unable to maintain his authority, the
King&#8217;s forces were to help him. The tribute was to be one in
every ten marketable hides. Roderic was not to meddle with
those lands which the King held in his own hands, or in those
of his barons: that is to say, Dublin with its appurtenances;
Meath with its appurtenances, in as ample a manner as
Murchat O&#8217;Melaghlin had held it; Wexford with its appurtenances,
and all Leinster; Waterford and Dungarvan with
its appurtenances, and all the lands between the two places.
Irish fugitives willing to return into the King&#8217;s land were to
have peace on paying the aforesaid tribute, &#8216;or by performing
the ancient accustomed services for their lands.&#8217; Those who
would not return were to be coerced by the King of Connaught,
who was to take hostages from all whom the King
granted to him, and to give hostages on his own part wherever
the King required him. No refugees from the King&#8217;s
lands were to be entertained by Irishmen under any pretence.
At the same time, as if to mark the fact that Irishmen were
his own subjects as well as Normans, Henry appointed
Augustine O&#8217;Sealbhaigh to the bishopric of Waterford, and
sent him, in charge of the Archbishop of Dublin, to be consecrated
by the Archbishop of Cashel. This was a confirmation
of the Eugenian constitution, and put an end to the succession
of the Danish bishops through Canterbury. Henry
had no wish to have future Beckets interfering in Ireland.
Canterbury was near and Rome was far.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry&#8217;s
original
policy frustrated
by
De Courcy.</div>

<p>The treaty with Roderic, if we accept it as Hoveden and
Benedict have handed it down, shows that a full conquest
of Ireland was not intended by Henry II. The possession
of the port-towns gave him the command of St.
George&#8217;s Channel, and a control over the trade of the island.
He had seen enough to know that a permanent conquest was
beyond the power of a feudal army, and his policy was to
balance the adventurers, his own creation De Lacy, and the
native princes against each other. Fitz-Adelm, a subtle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
intriguer with an eye for money, probably seemed a fitter
instrument for his purpose than any enterprising soldier.
But Fitz-Adelm brought with him to Ireland one of those
restless and unscrupulous men of action, who sometimes
disconcert the best laid plans of statesmen. John De Courcy
is represented by Giraldus as a tall, fair man, of immense
strength and extraordinary audacity, an experienced warrior,
though often more of a partisan than a general; but religious
in his way, and ever ready to ascribe to God the glory of any
successful exploit. He was the patron of the monk Jocelin,
who wove such a tangled web about St. Patrick, and he
carried with him everywhere a tract of St. Columba, which
was supposed to point him out as the destined conqueror of
Ulster. Seeing that neither gain nor glory could be had
under the Viceroy, De Courcy, in January 1177, boldly
marched into Ulster with twenty-two knights and 300 chosen
men. Among the knights were Almaric St. Lawrence,
ancestor of the Howth family, and Roger le Poer, apparently
a collateral ancestor of the Powers and Eustaces. In the
course of a year or two, though by no means always successful
in battle, De Courcy made himself supreme in eastern
Ulster. Where they had the advantage of the ground,
the natives were too much for the adventurers; but in a
fair field a hundred Normans, at least under such a leader
as De Courcy, were more than a match for 1,000 Irish.
Discipline and steadiness soon gave them the coast, and the
castles which they built everywhere enabled them to make
war or peace as they pleased. Downpatrick was John de
Courcy&#8217;s capital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">De Courcy

<p>O&#8217;Donlevy, chief king of Uladh, or that part of Ulster now
comprised in Antrim and Down, had done homage to Henry II.,
and imagined that he would be thus secured from invasion.
But the King evidently understood the matter differently, for
De Courcy had a grant from him of such northern lands as
he could conquer. Fitz-Adelm having failed as a Viceroy,
Henry now fell back upon Hugo de Lacy, who perhaps dreamed
of making himself independent. He distinguished himself
by good government from 1177 to 1181, and by showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
favour to the Irish; and he married a daughter of Roderic
O&#8217;Connor without the King&#8217;s consent. Henry accordingly
sent for De Lacy to England, and gave the viceregal authority
to John, Constable of Chester. The Lord of Meath succeeded
in making his peace, and was soon restored to the government;
Robert of Salisbury, a priest, being sent as a spy upon
him. De Lacy covered his own district with castles, Trim
being his capital. Delvin he granted to William Nugent,
his sister Rose&#8217;s husband, who became the ancestor of the
Earls of Westmeath. Other estates he gave to his friends
and followers, who founded many of the families of the Pale.
The Flemings, Lords of Slane, became the most important of
these. Other barons followed the example of De Lacy; and
Giraldus mentions that by the year 1182 castles were built
at or near Newtown Barry, Castle Dermot, Leighlin, Timahoe,
Athy, Narragh, and other places. The Meath castles, says
the chronicler, were too many to mention by name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John designated
as
King of
Ireland.</div>

<p>As early as 1177 Henry had nominated his son John
King of Ireland. For this he had the leave of Alexander III.,
and in 1186 Urban III. actually sent a crown of peacock&#8217;s
feathers set in gold for the King to crown one of his sons,
the choice being left to him. The intervening Pope, Lucius
III., had opposed the plan, and this may have been the
reason why it was never carried out. Or the King may have
hesitated to repeat even in John&#8217;s favour an experiment
which had succeeded so ill in the case of his eldest son.
The Oxford nomination of 1177 was allowed to take effect
only so as to constitute John Lord of Ireland, and this title
was afterwards assumed by the Kings of England. In the
sixteenth century it was by some taken as evidence that the
crown in Ireland was subject to the popes. But the idea of
a separate, though subordinate, kingdom was very nearly
realised. The acts of the colony were from the date of the
Oxford Council executed in the name of &#8216;John, Lord of
Ireland, son of the King of England,&#8217; and the first Anglo-Norman
coinage bore his face.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John sent
to Ireland
as Viceroy.</div>

<p>On March 31, 1185, the King knighted John at Windsor,
and on April 24 the latter, who was in his nineteenth year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
sailed from Milford Haven, with 300 knights and a large
body of troops. The expedition reached Waterford in safety
next day, and the neighbouring chiefs flocked to do honour
to the King&#8217;s son, and to give him the kiss of peace. The
Anglo-Norman courtiers&mdash;young men mostly&mdash;pulled their
long beards, and they at once departed to the hostile chiefs,
Roderic O&#8217;Connor, Donnell O&#8217;Brien, and Dermod MacCarthy.
All chance of conciliating the more powerful and distant
potentates was thus taken away. Giraldus Cambrensis was
present at Waterford, and he likens John to Rehoboam. The
Irish, who had adhered to the invaders since Fitz-Stephen&#8217;s
first landing, were deprived of their lands; the castles were
given up to favourites, who did nothing but eat, drink, and
plunder; the worst officers were put in the best places, and
the men, as a natural consequence, were as bad as their
masters, devoted to Venus and Bacchus, but neglectful of
Mars. Hoveden adds that John put all the profits of government
into his own pocket, and that his soldiers being unpaid
were useless in war. The three castles projected by his
father were built; but he lost many to the Irish, and De
Lacy was suspected of intriguing against him. It is clear
that there could be no confidence in a prince whose chief care
was to rob and displace the men who had won his principality
for him. The disastrous experiment lasted only eight months,
when John returned to England, leaving the government to
John de Courcy, who retained power until the death of
Henry II. The Lough Cé annalists, who wrote beyond the
Shannon, give the following account of John&#8217;s expedition:&mdash;&#8216;The
son of the King of the Saxons came to assume the
sovereignty of Erin ... afterwards he went across to complain
of Hugo de Lacy to his father; for it was Hugo de
Lacy that was King of Erin when the son of the King of the
Saxons came, and he permitted not the men of Erin to give
tribute or hostages to him.&#8217; To the Irish bordering on Meath
no doubt De Lacy seemed a veritable king. The Four Masters,
who were better acquainted with the English theory of
government, repeat this; but soften Hugo&#8217;s title of king into
that of the King of England&#8217;s deputy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Murder of
Hugh de
Lacy. The
colony continues
to
extend.</div>

<p>In or out of office, De Lacy continued to increase his dominion
in Meath, but his career was cut short not long after
John&#8217;s departure. Having encroached upon the lands of the
O&#8217;Caharneys, he was murdered while building a castle at
Durrow by a foster-relation of the injured clan. His death
was a great blow to the colonists, but his son Hugo succeeded
to scarcely diminished power, and is accused by Giraldus of
systematically thwarting De Courcy. Fitz-Stephen meanwhile
was carving out a principality in Munster, where he
would be tolerably free from official interference. He and
Milo de Cogan were joint grantees of Cork, and the latter
married his daughter Catherine to Maurice, son of Raymond
le Gros, to whom Dermod MacCarthy had given a portion of
North Kerry. From this alliance the Fitzmaurices sprung.
It is probable that in granting the land of the O&#8217;Connors to
a stranger, Dermod gave that over which he had no real
authority. The territory immediately round the city of Cork
was divided between Fitz-Stephen and Cogan, the former
taking that lying to the east, and the latter that lying to the
west. Fitz-Stephen&#8217;s share passed to his sister&#8217;s son,
Philip de Barry. Before the death of Henry II. the country
about Cork was studded with castles, but it is impossible to
say how far it was really conquered. Intermarriages with the
Irish were no doubt common from the first. The example set
by Strongbow and by Hugo de Lacy was not likely to want
imitators.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No conquest
of Ireland
under
Henry II.</div>

<p>The conquest of Ireland by Henry II., as it used to be
called, amounts on the whole to this. The coast from
Larne to Cork harbour was, at the date of the King&#8217;s death,
strongly held by the invaders, all the ports being in their
hands, and the principal points being defended by castles.
They were also pretty firmly established on the south side of the
Shannon estuary. The rivers of Leinster were in their hands,
and the central plain almost, if not quite as far west as the
Shannon. De Courcy had begun to assert his dominion over
Monaghan and Armagh. All the Danish towns except
Limerick were fully possessed by the conquerors. On the
other hand, the Irish were not expelled from any part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
island. The mountains which extend almost uninterruptedly
from Dublin to Waterford still sheltered the O&#8217;Tooles, the
O&#8217;Byrnes, the MacMurroughs, the O&#8217;Nolans, and other clans.
Fitz-Stephen had begun the conquest of what is now the
county of Cork, but the Irish were still in force on all sides of
the city. The natives generally had recovered in some degree
from their first alarm. The first invaders had been trained in
mountain warfare, but those who succeeded them were often
quite unfit to dispute the possession of hills and woods with
the light-armed natives. And there were jealousies between
Normans, English, and Welsh, which went far to neutralise the
strength of the colony. Had it not been for the dissensions of
the Irish themselves, it is probable that they would have confined
the invaders to the east coast. It was a quarrel between
Dermod MacCarthy and his son which brought the Geraldines
to Kerry; disputes among the O&#8217;Connors introduced De
Cogan, De Lacy, and De Courcy into Connaught; and,
though they effected nothing, they paved the way for the De
Burgos, to whose founder, William Fitz-Adelm, Henry granted
the whole of the western province. The King&#8217;s troubles with
his own sons, with the Holy See, and with France, prevented
him from attending to Ireland. It would have been better
for the peace of mankind had he made a real conquest,
instead of leaving it to barons, who lost much of their old
civilisation, and who disdained to learn anything from the
weaker people whom they oppressed.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">John acts
as lord of
Ireland
under his
father and
brother.</div>

<p>Richard I. did not interfere with his brother&#8217;s jurisdiction
over Ireland, and this may be the reason why the records of
the colony during his reign are so scanty. The invaders,
though they fought a good deal among themselves, continued
to extend their power, and gained a firm footing in Connaught.
Some years before the death of Henry II., Roderic&#8217;s
sons had invited the Anglo-Normans into his kingdom, and
in 1183 the last monarch of Ireland retired to the abbey of
Cong, where he died in 1198. His brother Cathal Crovdearg,
or Charles of the Red Hand, about whom many marvellous
stories are told, ultimately made himself supreme; but not
without the help of William Fitz-Adelm, who lost no opportunity
of advancing the claim given him by Henry&#8217;s
thoroughly unjustifiable grant. Fitz-Adelm, who had made
himself master of Limerick, at first opposed Cathal Crovdearg,
but joined him in 1201 and enabled him to triumph over all
competitors. The accession of John to the crown of England
put an end to the separate lordship of Ireland, but his successors,
until the time of Henry VIII., continued to call
themselves only lords of Ireland. If Berengaria had had
children, it is possible, and even probable, that Ireland
would have passed to John&#8217;s issue as a separate, or at the
most a tributary kingdom. The early years of John&#8217;s reign
were much disturbed by a violent feud between the De Lacies
and De Courcy. The King favoured the former party, and
in 1205 created the younger Hugo Earl of Ulster and
Viceroy. He proved an oppressive governor, over-taxing the
King&#8217;s subjects to provide means for his foreign enterprises.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
The southern colonists, in alliance with some of the natives,
defeated the Viceroy near Thurles, and the King began to fear
that he had given too much power to one family; for Walter
de Lacy continued to rule Meath, while his brother was all-powerful
in the north and east. A royal army was accordingly
levied, and John prepared to revisit the lordship where
he had so signally failed twenty-five years before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King John
visits
Ireland.</div>

<p>The excommunicated King sailed from Milford Haven
with a motley army of mercenaries, under command of
Fair Rosamond&#8217;s son, William Long-sword, and landed on
June 20, 1210, at the same place as his father had done.
Among his train were John de Grey, Bishop of Norwich,
whom Innocent III. had refused to make Archbishop of
Canterbury, and John de Courcy, who had been captured and
given up by the De Lacies, and who had suffered a rigorous
imprisonment, but was now again in favour with the King.
John did not let the grass grow under his feet. On the
eighth day after his arrival he was at Dublin, having travelled
by Ross, Thomastown, Kilkenny, and Naas. The first effect
of his presence was to separate the two De Lacies, and the
Lord of Meath sent him the following message:&mdash;&#8216;Walter
salutes the King as his liege lord, of whom he holds all he
possesses; and prays the King to relax his ire, and suffer
Walter to approach his presence; Walter will not plead
against the King, but places all his castles and lands in the
hands of the King as his lord, to retain or restore as he
pleases.&#8217; The messenger added that Walter had lost much
by his brother Hugo, and that he left him to the King&#8217;s
pleasure. It is possible that this was said in consequence of
an arrangement between the two brothers. John was not
pacified, and prepared to invade both Meath and Ulster.
Trim was reached by July 2, and Kells by the 4th, and the
Kings of Connaught and Thomond were summoned to take
part in the expedition to Ulster. Cathal Crovdearg and
Donough O&#8217;Brien both obeyed the King&#8217;s order, and the
royal army proceeded by Dundalk, Carlingford, and Downpatrick
to Carrickfergus. The latter place was taken and
garrisoned. Hugo de Lacy had already fled into Scotland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
The King stayed eight or nine days at Carrickfergus, where
he was visited by Hugh O&#8217;Neill, who does not appear to have
made any real submission, and then marched by Holywood,
Downpatrick, Banbridge, and Carlingford to Drogheda. From
Drogheda he again entered Meath, visited Duleek and Kells,
and seems to have penetrated as far west as Granard. He
was in Dublin by August 18, and back to England before
the end of the month, having spent sixty-six days in Ireland.
On his return from Ulster he had summoned Cathal Crovdearg
a second time, bidding him bring his son &#8216;to receive a charter
for the third part of Connaught.&#8217; Over-persuaded by his wife,
Cathal went to the King alone. John&#8217;s object may have been
to make a hostage of the boy, and he seized instead MacDermot
of Moylurg, O&#8217;Hara of Sligo, and two other men of
importance in Connaught. Carrying these chiefs with him
to England, the King left the government of Ireland to
Bishop de Grey, who signalised his advent to power by
building a castle and bridge at Athlone. William de Braose,
who had enormous estates in Ireland, was driven into exile
by John, who starved his wife and son to death, and gave
his castle of Carrigogunnel on the Shannon to Donough
O&#8217;Brien.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Anglo-Normans
flock to the
King. He
erects

shires.</div>

<p>The Anglo-Norman barons of Ireland flocked to Dublin
while John was there, and swore to obey the laws of England.
The King divided their country into twelve counties: Dublin,
Kildare, Meath, Uriel or Louth, Carlow, Kilkenny, and Wexford
in Leinster; and Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, and
Tipperary in Munster. Every knight&#8217;s fee was bound to
supply a well-armed horseman, and inferior tenants were
bound to provide foot-soldiers. The Viceroy was to give a
notice of forty days when the feudal array was to muster at
Dublin, and serve against the King&#8217;s enemies for forty days in
each year. Ulster and Connaught were not shired, but were
afterwards sometimes regarded as counties. Perhaps the
nobles of these provinces were supposed to be constantly
employed against the Irish. The native chiefs were considered
as tributary subjects, but not as tenants. In 1215
John ordered the Archbishop of Dublin to buy enough scarlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
cloth to make robes for the Kings of Ireland; and it is clear
that they were expected to serve, though the exact measure
of the aid rendered may have been left to themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leinster is

Richard&#8217;s
death.</div>

<p>When Strongbow died without a son the principality of
Leinster fell to his eldest daughter Isabel, who became a
ward of the Crown. In 1189 the minor was given in marriage
to William Earl Marshal, who thus became Earl of
Pembroke and Strigul, and lord of a territory in Ireland, corresponding
nearly to the counties of Wexford, Kildare, Carlow,
Kilkenny, and part of the Queen&#8217;s County. He built a
castle and incorporated a town at Kilkenny, and died in 1219,
transmitting his honours and great power to his son William.
The younger William was Viceroy in 1224, and depressed
the De Lacies, allying himself generally with Cathal Crovdearg
O&#8217;Connor. He died in 1231, leaving all to his brother
Richard, who made good his position, although Henry III.&#8217;s
foreign advisers plotted his destruction. Strongbow&#8217;s grandson
was killed in 1234 by the feudatories who were bound
to defend him, and the colony never recovered the blow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The De
Burgos in
Connaught.</div>

<p>Fitz-Adelm&#8217;s son, Richard de Burgo, generally called
MacWilliam by the Irish, married Una, Cathal Crovdearg&#8217;s
grand-daughter, and procured from Henry III. a grant of all
Connaught, except five cantreds reserved for the support of
the post at Athlone. From the first the position of the Anglo-Normans
in Connaught differed from their position in other
parts of Ireland. They were there rather as allies of the
native chiefs than as conquerors, and the easy lapse of their
descendants into Irish habits is the less to be wondered at.
Richard de Burgo obtained a confirmation of his grant in 1226,
through the favour of his kinsman, the great justiciar, Hubert,
and he soon afterwards made himself master of Galway,
which he fortified strongly, and made the chief place of Connaught.
After his time the O&#8217;Connors never regained possession
of it, and the importance of the royal tribe steadily
diminished during the whole of the thirteenth century.
Richard de Burgo&#8217;s eldest son Walter married Maud,
daughter and heiress of the younger Hugo de Lacy, who
died in 1243, and he thus became Earl of Ulster as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Lord of Connaught. His son Richard, commonly called the
Red Earl, advanced the power of the Anglo-Norman state to
the furthest point which it ever attained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poverty of
the colony
under
Henry III.</div>

<p>Constant war is not favourable to the production of wealth,
and it seems probable that no very considerable progress was
made in the arts of peace. Tallage was first imposed on
Ireland in 1217, in the name of Henry III., but it seems to
have yielded little, and a generation later there was equal
difficulty in collecting a tithe for the Pope. Innocent IV.
ordered that a sum should be so raised for the liberation of
the Holy Land, and very stringent letters were sent to Ireland
in 1254; but collector Lawrence Sumercote declared
that the difficulties were insuperable. The Irish, he explained,
never saved anything, but lived riotously and gave liberally
to all, and he professed that he would &#8216;rather be imprisoned
than crucified any longer in Ireland for the business of the
Cross.&#8217; The plan of drawing upon Ireland for English or
Continental wars was, however, largely practised during the
reign of Henry III., and it tended to sap the strength of the
colony. Ready money might be scarce, but there were men,
and they could be ill-spared from the work of defending their
lands against a native race who were ever on the watch to
take advantage of their absence or neglect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward I.
had not
time to
attend to
Ireland
personally.</div>

<p>A vast number of documents remain to show that Edward I.
took great pains about Ireland. Phelim O&#8217;Connor, who died
in 1265, may be regarded as the last King of Connaught.
His son Hugh did indeed assume the title, and, according to
the annalists, &#8216;executed his royal depredations on the men of
Offaly, where he committed many burnings and killings;&#8217; but
his kingship does not appear to have been officially recognised,
and the De Burgos were the true rulers. The Red Earl was
supreme in the northern half of Ireland; but O&#8217;Neill was
recognised as King of Tyrone, while his claim to be head of
all the Irish in Ireland was denied. O&#8217;Cahan was also sometimes
given the title of king. O&#8217;Donnell was treated with
less respect, and a price was set upon his head, which appears
to have been actually brought to Dublin in 1283. In 1281
Hugh Boy O&#8217;Neill, whom the annalists call &#8216;royal heir of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Erin, head of the hospitality and valour of the Gael,&#8217; sided
with the English against Donnell Oge O&#8217;Donnell, who is called
&#8216;King of the north, the best Gael for hospitality and dignity;
the general guardian of the west of Europe, and the knitting-needle
of the arch sovereignty, and the rivetting hammer of
every good law, and the top-nut of the Gael in valour.&#8217; A
battle was fought near Dungannon, and O&#8217;Donnell, who had
under him the O&#8217;Rourkes and MacMahons, and &#8216;nearly the
majority of the Irish of Connaught and Ulster,&#8217; was defeated
and slain. Two years later Hugh Boy was killed by the
MacMahons. The story of this contest is a good illustration
of the hopeless incapacity of the natives for anything like a
national combination. If Edward I. had been able to attend
to Ireland personally, it is at least probable that he would
have conquered the country as completely as Wales.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frequency
of quarrels
among the
colonists.</div>

<p>In 1275, Edward granted the whole of Thomond to
Thomas de Clare, who took advantage of the dissensions
among the O&#8217;Briens, and built the strong castle of Bunratty
to dominate the district. The conquest of Thomond was,
however, never completed, or nearly completed, nor did the
De Clares succeed in establishing themselves like the De
Burgos. They might have done so had they not come so late
into the field, and their failure was certainly not owing to
any exceptional power of combination shown by the Irish.
It was rather due to quarrels among the colonists, whose
strength was being constantly sapped by taking part in
Edward&#8217;s Scotch wars, and who were not recruited by any
considerable immigration. In 1245, the male line of the
Earl Marshal was finally extinguished, and the inheritance
of Strongbow fell to five sisters, the great grand-daughters of
Dermod MacMurrough. Matilda, the eldest, obtained Carlow
and carried the hereditary office of Earl Marshal to her
husband, Hugh Bigot, Earl of Norfolk. Joan, the second,
received Wexford. Isabella, the third, had Kilkenny, which
her descendants sold to the Ormonde family. Sibilla, the
fourth, had Kildare for her share. Eva, the youngest sister,
married William De Braose; and through her daughter, who
was married to Roger Mortimer, became ancestress of most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the royal houses of Europe. As the five daughters of William
Earl Marshal were all married, and had all children, the history
of Leinster becomes very confusing. Had it remained in one
strong hand the Irish would hardly have recovered their
ground. But, as Giraldus points out, the &#8216;four great pillars
of the conquest, Fitz-Stephen, Hervey, Raymond, and John
de Courcy, by the hidden but never unjust judgment of God,
were not blessed with any legitimate offspring.&#8217; A similar
fatality attended many others, including Earl Richard, to
whom, and not to Fitz-Stephen, common fame, more true in
this case than contemporary history, has attributed the real
leadership among the Anglo-Norman invaders of Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward I.
weakens
the colony
by drawing
men and
supplies
from it.</div>

<p>In his great campaign of 1296 Edward had much help
from Ireland. The Earl of Ulster was among those who led
contingents to Scotland, and the names of Power, Butler,
Fitzthomas, Wogan, Rocheford, Purcell, Cantoke, and Barry
appear among the leaders. The whole force from Ireland
consisted of 310 men-at-arms, 266 hobelers or horsemen
with unarmoured horses, and 2,576 foot, including many
archers and cross-bowmen. All who went received pardons,
but some refused or neglected to obey the royal summons.
In 1298 Edward drew provisions from Ireland. His requisition
included 8,000 quarters of wheat, chiefly fine flour in
casks; 10,000 quarters of oats; much bran, bacon, salt beef,
and salt fish; and 10,000 casks of wine. If so much wine
could not be got in Ireland, then the Viceroy was to agree
with some merchant to bring it from Gascony as quick as
possible. Edward used Ireland as a base for operations, or as
a recruiting ground, but he never had time to give it much
of his personal care. First Wales, then Gascony, then
Palestine, then Scotland engrossed his vast energies; but
Ireland was left to herself. Without the means to keep order
themselves, Viceroys found it necessary to preserve the colony
by stirring up dissensions among the Irish. The justiciar,
Robert d&#8217;Ufford, was sent for by Edward and charged with
this evil policy. He answered, that to save the King&#8217;s
coffers, and to keep the peace, he thought it expedient to
wink at one knave cutting off another. &#8216;Whereat,&#8217; says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
an old author, &#8216;the King smiled, and bade him return to
Ireland.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disorders
after the
death of
Edward I.</div>

<p>John&#8217;s imperfect partition of Ireland into shires was still
more imperfectly carried out. At the death of Edward I. four
out of his grandfather&#8217;s twelve counties&mdash;namely, Meath,
Wexford, Carlow, and Kilkenny&mdash;were liberties or exempt
jurisdictions in the hands of what Davies calls &#8216;absolute
palatines,&#8217; claiming and exercising almost every attribute of
sovereignty. The Fitzgeralds had acquired similar authority
over a portion of Desmond, and the De Clares over a portion
of Thomond. Connaught and Ulster were under the De
Burghs, in so far as they had been reduced at all, and Roscommon
was a royal castle and the head of a separate county.
At Randon on Lough Ree was another royal castle, and these
were almost the only strongholds of the Crown in Connaught;
for Galway was quite subject to the De Burghs. Within
their palatinate jurisdictions, the great nobles made barons
and knights, appointed sheriffs, and executed justice. The
King&#8217;s writ only ran in the Church lands, and was executed
by a separate sheriff. So complete was the distinction, that
in the mediæval parliaments knights were separately returned
for the counties and for the &#8216;crosses,&#8217; as the ecclesiastical
jurisdictions were called. The inherent weakness of such
a polity was probably aggravated by the suppression of the
Templars, who always kept a strong armed force. In 1308
Edward II. called for an account of their lands and revenues,
and the barons of the exchequer answered that they could
make no proper inquisition. &#8216;On account,&#8217; they wrote, &#8216;of
the long distances, and of the feuds between certain of the
magnates of Ireland, we do not dare to visit the places
named, and jurors of the country cannot come to us for the
same reason.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons
why the
colony declined.
The
Bruces invade
Ireland.</div>

<p>Dissensions among the barons, caused by the weakness
and absence of the Crown, were one great cause of the decline
of the colony. Another was the policy of Edward I., which
left him little time to attend to Ireland, and tempted him
constantly to draw supplies of men from thence. A third
was the battle of Bannockburn, which allowed victorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Scotland to compete with England for the dominion of the
neighbouring island; and the Irish themselves were not slow
to adopt the principle that England&#8217;s difficulty is Ireland&#8217;s
opportunity. In 1315 Edward Bruce landed near Larne
with 6,000 men, including some of the best knights in Scotland.
Having been joined by O&#8217;Neill and the chiefs depending
on him, Bruce twice defeated the Red Earl of Ulster,
occupied the strongholds of Down and Antrim, and wintered
in Westmeath. In the spring he overthrew the Viceroy, Sir
Edmund Butler, at Ardscull, for the Earl of Ulster disdained
to serve under the King&#8217;s representative, and the English
armies were therefore beaten in detail. Bruce gained another
battle at Kells, wasted all northern Leinster, and then returned
to Carrickfergus, where he was joined by King Robert
with reinforcements. The Scots went almost where they
liked, and Robert Bruce is said to have heard mass at
Limerick on Palm Sunday, 1317. They did not cross the
Shannon, and seem not to have gone further south than
Cashel. Dublin was not attacked, though the invaders came
as near as Castleknock. On Easter Thursday, 1317, Roger
Mortimer landed at Youghal with 15,000 men and full
viceregal powers, and the Bruces retired before him into
Ulster. They had devastated the country, and lost many men
from the famine which they themselves had caused.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bruces
fail to
conquer
Ireland.</div>

<p>The Bruces were descended from Strongbow and from
Dermod MacMurrough, and Robert&#8217;s wife was descended
from Roderic O&#8217;Connor. The true principles of hereditary
succession were not fully accepted, and they might pretend
some right to interfere in Ireland. They had been invited
by the De Lacies of Meath, who for want of male heirs saw
their territory divided between De Verdon and De Mortimer.
In the first flush of his victorious advance from the south,
Roger Mortimer called the De Lacies before him. They
refused to appear, and were proclaimed traitors, but continued
to adhere to Edward Bruce&#8217;s fortunes. The invader,
after his brother&#8217;s departure, remained for more than a
year at Carrickfergus, in hopes of being able to take the
offensive again, and still retaining the title of King, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
he had assumed after his first successes. He had been so
often victorious in battle that he despised the colonists, and,
against the advice of his Irish allies, resolved to fight once
more without waiting for reinforcements from Scotland. John
de Bermingham, at the head of an army which greatly outnumbered
the Scots, forced an engagement between Faughard
and Dundalk, and Bruce and most of his officers were killed.
The remnant of his army, with Walter and Hugo de Lacy,
managed to escape to Scotland. The sovereignty of the
English Crown in Ireland was never again seriously disputed;
but the feudal organisation was shattered by Bruce&#8217;s
invasion, which did nothing to compose the differences already
existing among the colonists. John de Bermingham
received a grant of Louth with the title of earl, but his
great services were soon forgotten, and eleven years after the
battle of Dundalk he was murdered by the English of his
own earldom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Horrible
cruelties of
the Bruces.</div>

<p>English and Irish are agreed as to the cruelty and ferocity
of the Bruces. Clyn the Franciscan records, in terse and
vigorous Latin, that &#8216;Robert Bruce, who bore himself as King
of the Scots, crossed Ireland from Ulster, where he landed,
almost to Limerick, burning, killing, plundering, and spoiling
towns, castles, and even churches, both going and returning.&#8217;
Clyn was an English partisan, but the same cannot be said
of the Lough Cé annalists, who record that &#8216;Edward Bruce,
the destroyer of all Erin in general, both foreigners and
Gaels, was slain by the foreigners of Erin, through the power
of battle and bravery at Dundalk; and MacRory, King of
the Hebrides, and MacDonnell, King of Argyll, together
with the men of Scotland, were slain there along with him;
and no better deed for the men of all Erin was performed
since the beginning of the world, since the Formorian race
was expelled from Erin, than this deed; for theft, and
famine, and destruction of men occurred throughout Erin
during his time for the space of three years and a half; and
people used to eat one another, without doubt, throughout
Erin.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Irish
fail to give
the Bruces
effectual
support.</div>

<p>There can, however, be no doubt that Edward Bruce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
came to Ireland on the invitation of the Irish. Donnell
O&#8217;Neill, claiming to be the true heir to the chief kingship,
and the other chiefs, in the famous remonstrance which they
addressed to John XXII., informed that Pope that they felt
helpless for want of a leader, but were determined no longer
to submit like women to Anglo-Norman oppression, and that
they had therefore invited over &#8216;the brother of the most
illustrious Lord Robert, by the grace of God King of the
Scots, and a descendant of the most noble of their own
ancestors,&#8217; and that they had by letters patent constituted
him king and lord. The blood of Roderic O&#8217;Connor and of
Eva evidently went for something, but the chiefs also believed
that Edward Bruce was &#8216;a person of piety and prudence, of
a chaste and modest disposition, of great sobriety, and altogether
orderly and unassuming in his demeanour.&#8217; Scottish
historians are not entirely of the same opinion. It is indeed
probable that Bruce had no other idea than to carve
out a kingdom with his sword, like a genuine Norman as he
was. He had the memory of Earl Richard, of Fitz-Stephen,
and of De Courcy to guide him; and if a more modern
instance was required, there could be none better than that
of his brother Robert.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Irish
never

The O&#8217;Connors
are
almost destroyed
by
the De Burgos.</div>

<p>The Irish invited Bruce, but they made no regular or general
effort in his favour. Their total incapacity for anything like
national organisation had forbidden the idea of a native
sovereign, and perhaps the majority of them thought one
Norman baron no better than another. The year 1316, in
which Bruce landed, witnessed the almost total destruction
of the O&#8217;Connors, the tribe which had last held the chief
kingship. Their relationship with the De Burgos, Berminghams,
and other Anglo-Normans may be traced in great
detail in the annalists. Felim O&#8217;Connor, whom the Connaught
historiographers call undisputed heir presumptive to the
sovereignty of Erin, formed one of those great confederacies
which occur so frequently in Irish history, and which so
seldom had any results. The O&#8217;Kellys, MacDermods,
O&#8217;Maddens, O&#8217;Dowds, O&#8217;Haras, O&#8217;Kearneys, O&#8217;Farrells,
MacMahons, and many others were represented; and the
Anglo-Normans, who also mustered in great force, were commanded
by the Red Earl&#8217;s brother, Sir William de Burgo,
and by Richard Bermingham, fourth baron of Athenry, at
the gate of which town the decisive struggle took place. The
Irish were defeated with the loss of something like 10,000
men. Felim O&#8217;Connor fell, and his tribe never recovered its
position in Connaught. In late times we have O&#8217;Connor Don
and O&#8217;Connor Roe in Roscommon, O&#8217;Connor Sligo, O&#8217;Connor
Kerry near the mouth of the Shannon, and O&#8217;Connor Faly
in what is now the King&#8217;s County, but the De Burgos
became supreme in Connaught.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Irish

under

and his

<p>In other parts of Ireland the Celts were more successful.
In 1317 or 1318 the O&#8217;Carrolls gained a victory over Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Edmund Butler, but Clyn places his loss at about two hundred
only. More important was the battle of Disert O&#8217;Dea, in
which Richard de Clare was defeated and slain. This fight
destroyed the pretensions of the De Clares, and the O&#8217;Briens
remained supreme in Thomond as long as such supremacies
lasted anywhere. In Leinster, too, the Irish became more
and more troublesome, and Clyn unwillingly records successes
of the O&#8217;Nolans and O&#8217;Tooles over the Poers and other settlers.
The dissensions of the colonists were yet more fatal than the
prowess of the natives. Eva&#8217;s descendants were for ever
fighting among themselves, and it was the Red Earl&#8217;s
jealousy of Sir Edmund Butler which prevented a united
effort from being made against Bruce. &#8216;After having
violently expelled us,&#8217; wrote the Irish to John XXII., &#8216;from
our spacious habitations and patrimonial inheritances, they
have compelled us to repair, in the hope of saving our lives,
to mountains and woods, to bogs and barren wastes, and to
the caves of the rocks, where, like the beasts, we have long
been fain to dwell.&#8217; The close of Edward II.&#8217;s reign saw them
everywhere ready to descend from their hills, and to emerge
from their woods. For nearly two hundred years the history
of Ireland is in the main a history of Celtic gains at the
expense of Anglo-Normans and Englishmen; if, indeed,
anarchy can rightly be accounted gain to any race or community
of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The last
Earl of
Ulster is
murdered,
1333. The
De Burgos
and other
Anglo-Normans
assume
Irish
names and
habits.</div>

<p>In 1326 the Red Earl of Ulster retired into the monastery
of Athassel, where he died soon afterwards. His great power
descended to his grandson William, who was murdered at or
near Carrickfergus in 1333 by the Mandevilles and other
Ulster colonists. By his wife, Maud Plantagenet, great-grand-daughter
of Henry III., he left one child, Elizabeth,
who was only a few months old at the date of his murder.
Twenty years afterwards she married Lionel Duke of Clarence,
and became ancestress of the Tudors and Stuarts. The
Earldom of Ulster thus ultimately merged in the Crown.
But the Irish De Burgos refused to acknowledge a baby, who,
as a royal ward, would be brought up independently of them;
and they preferred to follow the sons of Sir William, the Red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Earl&#8217;s brother. William the elder assumed the title of MacWilliam
Uachtar, or the Upper, took all Galway for his
portion, and became ancestor of the Clanricarde family. His
brother, Sir Edmund, as MacWilliam Iochtar, or the Lower,
took Mayo, and founded the family which bears that title.
They threw off their allegiance to England, and became more
Irish than the Irish. They reappear in the sixteenth century
under the modern name of Burke. About the same time
several other Anglo-Normans assumed Irish names. The
Stauntons became MacAveelys; the Berminghams MacFeoris;
the D&#8217;Exeters, MacJordans; the Barretts, MacAndrews, MacThomins,
MacRoberts, and MacPaddins; the Nangles, MacCostelloes;
the Mayo Prendergasts, MacMaurices. The De
Burgos themselves had many subordinate branches, each with
its peculiar Irish name, as MacDavid, MacPhilbin, MacShoneen,
MacGibbon, MacWalter, and MacRaymond. Nor
was the practice confined to Connaught. Some of the
Leinster Fitzgeralds became MacThomases and MacBarons;
and some of the same house in Munster were transfigured
into MacGibbons, MacThomaisins, and MacEdmonds. Many
other Anglo-Normans or English families were more or less
completely transformed in the same way. It is only necessary
to mention that the Wesleys or Wellesleys, who gave
England its greatest captain, were sometimes called MacFabrenes;
and that the Bissetts of Antrim, whose connections
in Scotland gave the Tudors such trouble, may still be traced
as Makeons. In the district near Dublin, which got the
name of the English Pale, some Irish residents took English
names, and the practice was encouraged by a statute of
Edward IV. There is probably no country in Europe where
the population is so thoroughly mixed as it is in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward
III. creates
three great
earldoms:
Kildare,
Desmond,
and
Ormonde.</div>

<p>As the Earls of Ulster disappear, other families attain
prominence, and the earlier Tudor history is mainly occupied
with the struggles of three earldoms, created in the first half
of the fourteenth century. The name Geraldine, to which
Giraldus Cambrensis gave a more extended signification, was
in later times confined to the descendants of Maurice Fitzgerald,
one of Nesta&#8217;s many sons. One branch was firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
settled in Kildare before the death of Henry II., and in the
reign of Edward I. the head of it was John Fitz-Thomas,
whose dissensions with William de Vesci, Lord of Kildare,
ended in an appeal to the King, and a challenge to the trial by
combat. Fitz-Thomas was the challenger, and on his adversary
failing to appear, he received a royal grant of De Vesci&#8217;s
lands. In 1316 Edward II. created him Earl of Kildare, and
the Duke of Leinster is descended from him. During most
of the fifteenth century, and for the first third of the sixteenth,
this was on the whole the most powerful family in
Ireland. The Earls of Kildare commanded the whole strength
of that county, and its proximity to Dublin often enabled
them to control the government. Meath was too much divided
for its proprietors to act as a counterpoise, and the strength
of the rival house of Ormonde lay at a distance from the
capital, and was exposed to attacks from another branch of
the Geraldines, whose chief was created Earl of Desmond in
1329. The Desmonds first rose at the expense of the MacCarthies
in Kerry. A marriage with the heiress of Fitz-Anthony
brought them the western half of the county Waterford and
other large estates. This lady&#8217;s son married the heiress of
the Cogans, and her great property in Cork was added to
the rest. The Desmonds never became quite so completely
Hibernicised as the De Burgos; but they attained something
very like independence, and more than once proved too strong
for the government. The third great earldom was founded
in the person of Edmund Butler, who was created Earl of
Carrick in 1315; the better known title of Ormonde being
conferred on his son James in 1328. The founder of the
family was Theobald Fitz-Walter, who accompanied Henry II.
to Ireland, and was by him made hereditary butler with a
grant of the prisage of wines. The name of office was adopted
by his descendants, who derived great advantage from the
grant. Ormonde is properly the northern part of Tipperary,
but the earls became palatine lords of nearly all the county,
and owners of vast estates in Kilkenny and Wexford. Their
principal castles were Kilkenny, Gowran, Carrick-on-Suir,
and Arklow. The possession of the latter place gave them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
ready access to England, and through all turns of weal and
woe they ever remained faithful to the Crown. If regard be
had to the length of time that it retained eminence, or to
the average ability of its chiefs, or to its comparative civilisation
in rude times, the House of Ormonde must be accounted
the most distinguished of the Anglo-Norman families of
Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Towns in
Ireland:
Dublin
and Drogheda.</div>

<p>The native Irish had no regular towns. The Anglo-Normans
took possession of those founded by the Ostmen, which
were all on the coast, and founded many others, of which only
three or four, and those not the most important, were at a
distance from navigable rivers. Athassel in Tipperary is
sometimes called a town, but it never became a municipality,
and can have been little more than an aggregation of poor
houses about the great monastery, and there may have been
other similar cases. Dublin obtained its first charter from
Henry II. in 1171 or 1172, and Drogheda from Henry III.
in 1229.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dublin and Drogheda,&#8217; says the historian of the Irish
capital, &#8216;were neither distinctly English nor Irish. Their
citizens, as tax-contributing and acknowledged subjects of
England, relied on her for protection against oppressive
Anglo-Norman nobles and hostile natives. The Irish&mdash;unless
Anglicised&mdash;had no legal part in these communities, but
continuous mutual intercourse was sustained by the advantages
derived from traffic.&#8217; &#8216;In our documents,&#8217; adds the
same writer, &#8216;Scandinavians or Ostmans but rarely appear,
although in 1215 the latter people were of sufficient importance
to have been associated with the English of Dublin by
King John as parties to an inquiry held there by his justiciary.
The proportion of the various national elements cannot
be absolutely determined by the forms of names;&#8217; for
many names originated in personal peculiarities, many were
translated from one language to another, and many Irishmen
became denizens, and adopted an English patronymic. The
&#8216;Irish town&#8217; which exists outside the old bounds of Dublin,
Limerick, Kilkenny, Clonmel, and other places, doubtless
perpetuates the memory of a time when the natives congre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>gated
in the neighbourhood of civic communities to which
they did not belong.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
towns:
Limerick,
Waterford,
and Cork
the chief.</div>

<p>What has been said of Dublin and Drogheda applies to
the other cities and towns of Ireland. Limerick received its
first charter from John in 1197, Waterford from the same
prince in 1206, and Cork from Henry III. in 1242. These
were the chief centres of trade and of English law in the
south of Ireland. The less important municipalities owed
their origin generally to some great noble, the Crown afterwards
adopting them and granting fresh privileges. Kilkenny
received a charter from the Earl Marshal between 1202 and
1218. New Ross, well situated at the junction of the Nore
and Barrow, belonged to the same great man, and excited the
jealousy of Waterford at least as early as 1215. Clonmel
was included in a grant made by Henry II. to Otho de
Grandison. It passed into the hands of the De Burgos, who
probably incorporated it, and who received a royal grant to
hold a fair there in 1225. Fethard, Callan, Gowran, and
other inland towns were of less consequence, but were still
distinctly English in origin and character. Youghal and
Kinsale were also corporate towns. The latter received a
charter from Edward III. in 1333, and the former, which had
been long identified with the Desmond family, seems not to
have been regularly incorporated till 1462. The Kinsale
charter recites that the town was surrounded by Irish enemies
and English rebels, and that the burgesses were worn out in
repelling the same. The mediæval kings commonly granted
the customs and tolls of loyal towns to be expended by the
inhabitants in repairing their walls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Galway.</div>

<p>Galway has a history of its own. The O&#8217;Connors had a
fortified post there before the Anglo-Norman invasion, and
it soon attracted the attention of the invaders. In 1232
it was for the first time taken by Richard de Burgo, who
lost it once, but recovered it and made it the capital of his
province. The building of the walls was begun about the
beginning of the reign of Edward I., and murage charters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
were granted probably by that king, and certainly by Edward
III. and Richard II. A charter of incorporation was granted
in 1396, but the names of certain chief magistrates, provosts,
portreeves, and sovereigns, are preserved from 1274 to 1485,
when the first mayor took office. Fourteen English families,
afterwards known as the tribes of Galway, engrossed civic
power, and from 1485 to 1654 every mayor, with a single
doubtful exception, was chosen from among them. When the
De Burgos turned Irish and renounced their allegiance, the
loyal citizens soon learned to treat them as enemies, and in
1518 the corporation resolved that no inhabitant should receive
into his house &#8216;at Christmas, Easter, nor no feast else, any of
the Burkes, MacWilliams, the Kellys, nor no sept else, without
licence of the mayor and council, on pain to forfeit 5<i>l.</i> that
neither O nor Mac shall strut nor swagger through the streets
of Galway.&#8217; Their great enemies were the O&#8217;Flaherties of
Iar-Connaught, and it is said the prayer &#8216;from the ferocious
O&#8217;Flaherties, good Lord, deliver us,&#8217; was once inscribed over
the west gate of the town. Athenry, which was built by the
Bermingham family, was long and closely connected with
Galway. It received a murage charter in 1312.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Anglo-Norman
families of
importance.</div>

<p>Besides the three great earldoms, there were several
Anglo-Norman families who continued to have considerable
importance in Tudor times. Robert le Poer, or De Poher,
received a grant from Henry II., which made his descendants,
now generally called Power, supreme in the eastern half of
the county Waterford. In the middle ages they were often
at war with the citizens of Waterford. Their chief seat was
Curraghmore, and they are represented, through a lady, by
the Marquis of Waterford. The western half of the same
county, which came by marriage to the Desmonds, fell to the
descendants of the seventh earl&#8217;s second son, known as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Fitzgeralds, of Decies, and seated at Dromana. The Fitzmaurices,
descended from Raymond le Gros, occupied that
part of north Kerry which is still called Clanmaurice. They
became Barons of Lixnaw, and are represented by the
Marquis of Lansdowne. The family of the White Knight
was descended from Gilbert, eldest son of John More Fitzgerald
by his second wife, Honora O&#8217;Connor; his half brother
by Margery Fitz-Anthony being the first Earl of Desmond.
The White Knights were called Macgibbon and Fitzgibbon,
and their memory is preserved by the barony of Clangibbon,
in the county of Cork. From John, the second of Honora
O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s sons, is descended the Knight of the Valley,
or of Glin on the Shannon. Maurice, the third brother, was
the first Knight of Kerry. Another branch of the Fitzgeralds,
known as hereditary seneschals of Imokilly, were
settled in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries at Castle
Martyr. The Barrys, descendants of Nesta as well as the
Geraldines, were settled in that part of the county of Cork
called Barrymore; and the Roches were established soon after
the first invasion about Castletown-Roche, and Fermoy. Of
the families who obtained portions of De Lacy&#8217;s great territory,
the most important were the Nugents, Barons of Delvin,
and the Flemings, Barons of Slane on the Boyne. The
Plunkets, who are supposed to be of Danish origin, were in
the middle ages settled chiefly in Meath; and there they are
still. They became Barons of Killeen, Dunsany, and Louth.
The Prestons, Viscounts of Gormanston, and the Barnewalls,
Barons of Trimleston, may also be noticed; but all the
families of the Pale were overshadowed by the House of
Kildare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The colony
steadily declines
under
Edward
III.</div>

<p>So far as the English colony in Ireland is concerned, the
long reign of Edward III. must be regarded as a period of
decay. The murder of the last Earl of Ulster in 1333, and
the consequent secession of the De Burghs, hastened the destruction
of a fabric which had always hung loosely together.
The sons of Hugh Boy O&#8217;Neill, who was killed in 1283,
established themselves firmly in Eastern Ulster, and undid
nearly all the work of De Courcey and his successors. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
gave to Antrim the name of Clan-Hugh-Boy, or Clandeboye,
as it is now written. Only the Savages maintained themselves
in Ardes; and the MacQuillins, a family of Welsh origin,
between the Bush and the Bann, in the district afterwards
called the Route. The three royal fortresses which bridled
Connaught, Athlone, Roscommon, and Randon, all fell into
the hands of the Irish. In Leinster also the natives rapidly
gained ground. Lysaght O&#8217;More formed a confederacy of
nearly all the midland tribes, and expelled the settlers from
the district between the Barrow and the Shannon. His
career was short, but his work was lasting. &#8216;In 1342,&#8217; says
Clyn, &#8216;he was killed when drunk by his own servant. He
was a rich and powerful man, and honoured among his own
people. He expelled nearly all the English from his lands,
and burned eight of their castles in one evening. He destroyed
Roger Mortimer&#8217;s noble fortress of Dunamase, and
usurped the lordship of his own country. He was a servant,
he became a lord; he was a subject, he became a prince.&#8217;
Bunratty Castle in Clare was dismantled by the O&#8217;Briens and
Macnamaras, and a branch of the former established themselves
in Tipperary. Of William Carragh O&#8217;Brien, of
Aherlow, one of the chiefs of this sept, Clyn gives a very
unflattering account. &#8216;He was,&#8217; he declares, &#8216;a bad and
perverse man who lived ill and died ill, passing all his time
in waylayings, thefts, spoils, and murders.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissension
rife among
the colonists.</div>

<p>The constant quarrels of the colonists, and the corruption
of their officials, laid them open to the attacks of the natives,
and the state of Ireland attracted so much attention that the
Parliament held at Westminster in 1331 advised the King
to cross the Channel himself. Edward III. never had much
time to attend to Ireland, but he seems to have been aware
that he had duties in the matter. In 1338 he decreed that
none but Englishmen born should fill legal offices; but this
did not mend matters, and the administration of justice
continued to be as corrupt as ever. The new comers
married in Ireland, and were as ready to job for their
children as if they had been descended from the first
colonists. In 1341 the King ordered that Englishmen with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
estates in England should be preferred, but the supply of
such men was necessarily limited. The main cause of the
corruption prevalent was no doubt the poverty of the Crown.
Officials were ill paid, or not paid at all, and they supported
themselves by embezzling funds or by selling justice. An
unjust proposal to increase the revenue by resuming royal
grants naturally aggravated every evil, and the English by
blood were arrayed against the English by birth. Sir John
Morris, the deputy who was ordered to carry out the new
policy, summoned a Parliament to meet at Dublin in October,
1341. But Maurice Fitz-Thomas, first Earl of Desmond,
persuaded a large section of the nobility to ignore the writs,
to attend a rival assembly at Kilkenny, and to draw up a remonstrance
addressed to the King. The malcontents wished
to be informed how a governor without military skill could
rule a land where war never ceased, how an official could
become quickly rich, and how it came about that the King
was never the richer for Ireland? Edward abandoned the
intention of resuming the grants, but subsequent events show
that he did not really forgive Desmond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">D&#8217;Ufford&#8217;s
futile attempts
to
recover the
Earldom of
Ulster.</div>

<p>Ralph d&#8217;Ufford had married Maud Plantagenet, widow
of the murdered Earl of Ulster, and in 1344 he was sent over
as Viceroy with very large powers. One of his objects was to
resume possession of Ulster for the benefit of his step-daughter,
the royal ward; but he totally failed in obtaining
rent out of the lands, or in ousting those who had seized
them. After chastising the Irish in the neighbourhood of
Dublin, d&#8217;Ufford resolved to invade Ulster with a regular
army. The MacArtanes attacked him at the Moyrie Pass,
and he narrowly escaped annihilation. Having cut his way
through with the help of the settlers in Louth and Monaghan,
he made his way into the northern province, but no permanent
results followed. Desmond and others having refused to
attend his Parliament, the Viceroy went to Kerry, took Castle
Island, and hanged its principal defenders. He imprisoned
the Earl of Kildare and seized his estates, and then took
action upon a bond executed in 1333, by which twenty-six of
the chief men of the colony became bound for Desmond&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
good behaviour. Many of the sureties had aided the Viceroy,
but he, nevertheless, seized their lands. The Earl of Ormonde
and two more were the only exceptions. The ruin caused
by this policy was out of all proportion to the good, and in
the history of the English in Ireland no one has a worse name
than Sir Ralph d&#8217;Ufford, except perhaps his high-born wife,
whose resentments were supposed to guide him. His hand
was as heavy against the Church as against the temporal
nobles. The annalist Pembridge, who was a contemporary,
declares that he brought bad weather to Ireland, and that it
lasted all his time. &#8216;On Palm Sunday,&#8217; says the same writer,
&#8216;which was on April 9, 1346, Ralph d&#8217;Ufford died, whose
death was very much lamented by his wife and family; but
the loyal subjects of Ireland rejoiced at it, and both the clergy
and laity for joy celebrated a solemn feast at Easter. Upon
his death the floods ceased, and the air again grew wholesome,
and the common people thanked God for it.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Crown did nothing for Ireland. Torn by intestine
quarrels, and denied a just government, the colony grew
yearly weaker. Many of the settlers found their position
intolerable, and, in spite of severe ordinances, absenteeism
constantly increased. In 1361 Edward summoned to Westminster
no less than sixty-three non-resident landowners,
including the heads of several great abbeys, who derived
revenues from Ireland and gave nothing in return. They
were ordered to provide an army suitable for the King&#8217;s son
Lionel, Duke of Clarence and Earl of Ulster by marriage,
who proceeded to Ireland as Viceroy. He was accompanied
by his wife, but failed, as D&#8217;Ufford had done, to obtain any
profit from her lordship of Ulster, and was scarcely successful
even against the clans near Dublin. The O&#8217;Byrnes and
O&#8217;Tooles cut off many of his English soldiers, and the Duke
was obliged to seek aid from the more experienced colonists.
Like many governors who have come to Ireland with great
pretensions, Lionel found his position most humiliating, and
he spent a great part of his time in England. His authority
was delegated to deputies, and the feuds between English by
blood and English by birth ran higher than ever. In 1367
he returned and summoned a Parliament, whose enactments
gave legal sanction to the fact that the King was no longer
lord of more than a comparatively small portion of Ireland.</p>

<p>The statute of Kilkenny contains a great many rather
heterogeneous rules. What makes it of such great importance
is its formal recognition of the existence of an English
Pale, and of a hostile Irish people outside it. The word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Pale may not have been in use for a century later, but the
thing was fully established.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Composition
of
the Parliament
of
Kilkenny.</div>

<p>The Parliament of Kilkenny did not, however, confine
its attention to the narrow limits of the &#8216;four obedient shires.&#8217;
The distinction between English and Irish land was conceded,
but it was still hoped that most of the shireland would be
preserved to English law. The sheriffs or seneschals of ten
counties or liberties, comprising all Leinster, except the
modern King&#8217;s and Queen&#8217;s Counties, as well as Tipperary
and Waterford, were required to produce their accounts at
Dublin; but those of Connaught, Kerry, Cork, and Limerick
were excused on account of distance, and were required only
to attend commissioners of the exchequer when they came to
their bailiwicks, and to render an account to them. Ulster,
the Duchess of Clarence&#8217;s patrimony, is not even mentioned
by her husband&#8217;s Parliament. Of the composition of that
assembly we have no record, but it was attended by the Archbishops
of Dublin, Cashel, and Tuam, and by the Bishops
of Waterford and Lismore, Killaloe, Ossory, Leighlin, and
Cloyne. The Archbishops of Cashel and Tuam and the Bishop
of Killaloe were Irishmen; the rest were of English race, and
some of them born in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Statute of
Kilkenny
endeavours
to separate
the two
races.</div>

<p>The statute begins by reciting that for a long time after
the conquest the English in Ireland spoke English, and in
general behaved like Englishmen; but that of late years many
had fallen away and adopted the Irish language and habits,
whereby the King&#8217;s authority and the English interest were
depressed, and the Irish enemy &#8216;against reason&#8217; exalted. In
order to remedy this marriage, fosterage, gossipred, and
even concubinage with the Irish was declared high treason.
Supplying horses and armour to Irishmen at any time was
visited with like penalties, and so was furnishing them with
provisions in time of war. Englishmen and even Irishmen
living among the English were to speak English, to bear
English names only, and to ride and dress in the English
fashion, on pain of forfeiture until they should submit and find
security. If they had no lands they might lie in prison till
security was forthcoming. Special penalties were provided for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
offenders who had 100<i>l.</i> a year in land. The English born in
Ireland and in England were to be in all respects equal, and
were not to call each other English hobbe or Irish dog, on pain
of a year&#8217;s imprisonment and a fine at the King&#8217;s pleasure.
War with the Irish was inculcated as a solemn duty, and the
practice of buying off invasions was condemned. The end
aimed at was that Irish enemies should be finally destroyed,
and many minute rules were made for arming the colony properly.
The rude Irish game of hurling was discountenanced,
and the borderers were enjoined to make themselves fit for
constant war by practising such gentlemanlike sports as
archery and lance-play. Imprisonment and fine were to follow
a neglect of these precepts. Provision was made to prevent
the Irish from forestalling the markets by establishing fairs
of their own, and from grazing their cattle in the settled districts.
Very severe regulations were made against Irish
hangers-on&mdash;pipers to wit, story-tellers, babblers, and rhymers,
all of whom acted habitually as spies. The keeping of kerne
and idlemen, armed or unarmed, at the expense of other
people, was sternly forbidden, and qualified as open robbery.
It became, nevertheless, the greatest and commonest of all
abuses. Private war among the English was to be punished
as high treason, and so was the common practice of enticing
friendly Irishmen to acts of violence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Statute of
Kilkenny
respects the
Church,
but makes
distinctions.</div>

<p>The rights and privileges of Holy Church were jealously
guarded by the Parliament of Kilkenny. Persons excommunicated
for infringing her franchises were to be imprisoned
by the civil power until restitution was made. Tithes were
specially protected, and the excommunicated were not to be
countenanced by King or people. But the distinction between
the hostile races was maintained in matters ecclesiastical.
No Irishman was to be admitted by provision, collation, or
presentation among the English. Such preferments were
declared void, and the next presentation was to lapse to the
Crown. Religious houses situated among the English were
strictly forbidden to receive Irishmen, but Englishmen by
birth and by blood were given equal rights. The Irish
prelates present probably found no difficulty in accepting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
these principles, for they might, and did, retaliate by refusing
to receive English clerks in Irish districts. The Archbishops
and Bishops assembled at Kilkenny lent a special sanction to
the statute by agreeing to excommunicate all who broke it,
and they declared such offenders duly excommunicated in
advance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
the Statute
of Kilkenny.</div>

<p>Sir John Davies, with less than his usual accuracy, has
declared that &#8216;the execution of these laws, together with the
presence of the King&#8217;s son, made a notable alteration in the
state and manners of the people within the space of seven
years, which was the term of this prince&#8217;s lieutenancy.&#8217; Now,
the Statute of Kilkenny was not passed till 1367, and Lionel
died in 1368. The Act of Henry III., on which Davies chiefly
founded his statement, says the land continued in prosperity
and honour while the Kilkenny laws were executed, and fell
to ruin and desolation upon their falling into abeyance. But
the annalists tell a different story, and it is not easy to say
what those fat years were. In 1370, only three years after
the passing of the much vaunted statute, the Earl of Desmond
and others were taken prisoners by the O&#8217;Briens and Macnamaras,
and the deputy, Sir William de Windsor, was
obliged to leave the O&#8217;Tooles unchastised in order to hurry
to the defence of Munster. Newcastle, within a day&#8217;s ride
from Dublin, was taken and dismantled. The judges could
not get as far as Carlow. In 1377 the O&#8217;Farrells gained a
great advantage over the English of Meath. The general
result of the fighting during the ten years which followed the
Parliament of Kilkenny was that the Irish retained possession
of at least all which they had previously won. What the
statute really did was to separate the two races more completely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward
III.
weakens
the colony
by drawing
men from
it.</div>

<p>Edward III. repeated his grandfather&#8217;s mistake, and drew
away many of the colonists to his Scotch and Continental
wars. An Anglo-Irish contingent fought at Halidon Hill,
and it was while making preparations for that campaign
that the Earl of Ulster lost his life. Ireland was also well
represented at Creçy, and many brave men fell victims to
disease at Calais. The Viceroys sent over from time to time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
seem to have been regarded as licensed oppressors, and
it is recorded of many that they left Dublin without paying
their debts. Sir Thomas Rokeby, who was Deputy in 1349
and 1356, is praised by the contemporary chronicler Pembridge
for beating the Irish well, and for paying his way
honestly. &#8216;I will,&#8217; he said, &#8216;use wooden cups and platters,
but give gold and silver for my food and clothes, and for the
men in my pay.&#8217; That this golden saying, as Davies calls it,
should have been thought worth recording shows what the
general practice was. The three great pestilences which
ravaged England ran their course in Ireland also. It was
to the first of these visitations that the annalist Clyn succumbed.
&#8216;I have,&#8217; he records, &#8216;well weighed what I have
written, as befits a man who dwells among the dead in daily
expectation of death; and lest the writer should perish with
the writing, and the work with the workman, I leave parchment
for a continuation, if by chance any of the race of
Adam should escape this plague and resume my unfinished
task.&#8217; On the whole, the reign of Edward III. must be
regarded as one of the most disastrous in the annals of the
English in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard II.
determines
to visit
Ireland.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His first
visit, 1394.</div>

<p>The reign of Richard II. is mainly remarkable for the
King&#8217;s two visits to Ireland. But that step was not taken
until many others had failed. James Butler, third Earl of
Ormonde, was Viceroy when the old King died. He continued
in office, and held a Parliament at Castle Dermot, whose
deliberations were interrupted by an invasion of Leinster on
the western side. The O&#8217;Briens were bought off with 100
marks, but there were only nine in the treasury, and the residue
was supplied by individuals who gave horses, a bed, or moderate
sums of money. Ormonde resigned an office which there
was no means of supporting properly, and the Earl of Kildare
refused the post. In 1380 Edmund Mortimer, Earl of
March, who claimed Ulster through his wife Philippa, the
daughter of Duke Lionel, agreed to accept the burden for
three years. He covenanted for 20,000 marks and for absolute
control over the revenue of Ireland. The Irish scarcely
ventured to oppose him openly; and he recovered Athlone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
built a bridge at Coleraine, put down rebels in southern
Leinster, and might have extended his power still further had
he not died of a chill, caught in fording a river near Cork.
Ormonde and Desmond refused to accept the vacant government,
and the Irish continued to enlarge their borders. In
1385 Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, the King&#8217;s favourite
and grandson of Ralph d&#8217;Ufford and the Countess of Ulster,
was appointed Viceroy for life, and created first Marquis of
Dublin, and then Duke of Ireland. All the attributes of
royalty, such as the right to coin money and issue writs in
his own name, were conferred on him, and he undertook to
pay the King 5,000 marks a year, which the latter agreed to
remit until the conquest of Ireland was complete. De Vere
did not visit Ireland; but the government was carried on in
his name for some years, during which the colony grew
weaker and weaker. Nor did his disgrace make any more
difference than his appointment had done. Limerick and
Cork could scarcely defend themselves. Waterford was
harassed by the Le Poers and their Irish allies. Towns in
Kildare were burned, and the English Bishop of Leighlin
was unable to approach his diocese. Galway threw off its
allegiance, and sought the protection of MacWilliam. In
1391 the Earl of Ormonde was again persuaded to undertake
the government with a salary of 3,000 marks; but he could
do little more than temporise. Payments to the Irish were
frequent, and as they constantly advanced the dispossessed
settlers carried the story of their woes to England. Proclamations
against absentees were of small effect, and at last the
King determined to go himself. He landed at Waterford on
October 2, 1394, with 4,000 men at arms and 30,000 archers.
As soon as Art MacMurrough, whom the Leinster Irish
accepted as their king, heard of Richard&#8217;s arrival, he attacked
New Ross, &#8216;burned its houses and castles, and carried away
gold, silver, and hostages.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard
has but
little
success.</div>

<p>Richard II.&#8217;s army, augmented as it was by the forces
of the colony, was the largest seen in Ireland during the
middle ages, and has hardly been exceeded in modern times.
William III. had about 36,000 at the Boyne. Nothing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
performed worthy of so great a host or of the King&#8217;s presence.
One division of the royal army was defeated with great loss
by the O&#8217;Connors of Offaly, and another by the O&#8217;Carrolls.
Richard saw that his troops were unfit for war in bogs and
mountains, and could not but confess that the natives had
many just causes of complaint. He adopted a conciliatory
policy, and induced O&#8217;Neill, O&#8217;Connor, MacMurrough, and
O&#8217;Brien, as representatives of the four royal Irish races, to do
homage and to receive the honour of knighthood at his hands.
These four, and a great number of other chiefs, bound themselves
to the King by indenture; but no money was actually
paid, and for all practical purposes Caligula&#8217;s shells were
quite as good a badge of conquest. The German princes had
a right to say that Richard was not fit for empire, since he
had been unable to subdue his rebellious subjects of Ireland.
He remained nine months in the island, and left the government
to Roger Mortimer, Earl of March, heir-presumptive to
the Crown, and claiming to be Earl of Ulster in right of his
mother, the only child of Lionel, Duke of Clarence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Irish
grow continually
stronger.
Richard&#8217;s
second
visit, 1399.</div>

<p>Besides the earldom of Ulster, Mortimer claimed enormous
estates all over Ireland, but possession had been completely
divorced from feudal ownership. He attacked the Wicklow
clans, but was defeated with loss. In 1398 he made a final
attempt to recover some portion of his Leinster inheritance,
but was defeated and slain in Carlow by the O&#8217;Tooles,
O&#8217;Nolans, and Kavanaghs. In the following year Richard
again visited Ireland in person. His army was nearly as
large as on the first occasion, and vast quantities of stores
had been collected. The Crown jewels were carried with the
King, as was a yet more precious flask of oil which had
been transmitted straight from heaven to Archbishop Becket
while praying at the shrine of Columba. But neither arms,
nor gems, nor even the sacred chrism had any effect upon
Art MacMurrough. The King again landed at Waterford,
and after a few days&#8217; rest moved forward to meet the redoubtable
Irishman, who was posted in a wood with 3,000 men.
An open space having been secured by burning houses and
villages, Richard knighted young Henry of Lancaster, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
future victor of Agincourt, and ordered a large number of
labourers to fell the wood which sheltered the enemy. Aided
by the ground, MacMurrough held the royal army in check
for eleven days. The communications were cut, and the men
at arms had nothing but green oats for their horses. It was
early in July; but the weather was wet, and the whole army
suffered from exposure and hunger. A convoy which arrived
at Waterford rather added to the disaster. &#8216;Soldiers,&#8217; says a
contemporary chronicler, &#8216;rushed into the sea as if it were
straw.&#8217; Casks were broached, and more than 1,000 at a time
were seen drunk with the Spanish wine. Abandoning the
hope of attacking the Kavanaghs in their fastnesses, Richard
made his way to Dublin, the Earl of Gloucester having failed
to treat with MacMurrough.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard&#8217;s
failure.</div>

<p>The Leinster chieftain had married an Anglo-Norman
heiress, and through her claimed the barony of Narragh in
Kildare. He demanded to be put in full possession of his
wife&#8217;s lands, and to be left unmolested to enjoy his chiefry.
Otherwise he refused to come to any terms with the King.
Richard threatened, but his Irish plans were interrupted by
the news that Henry of Lancaster had landed in England.
He lingered for some weeks in Ireland, and that delay was
fatal to him. He reached Milford only to find that he had
no longer a party, and thus Art MacMurrough may be said
to have crowned the House of Lancaster. The Irish chief
continued irreconcilable, and defied the Government until
his death in 1417.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ireland
neglected
by
Henry IV.</div>

<p>With a bad title and an insecure throne Henry IV. could
not be expected to pay much attention to Ireland. The
strength of the colony continued to decline during his reign.
He made his second son, Thomas, Viceroy, but a child in his
twelfth year was not the sort of governor required. The
treasury was empty, and the young prince&#8217;s council had soon
to announce that he had pawned his plate, and that not
another penny could be borrowed. The soldiers had deserted,
the household were about to disperse, and the country was so
much impoverished that relief could scarcely be hoped for.
The settlement was only preserved by paying black mail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the Irish. The towns defended themselves as they best could,
and sometimes showed considerable martial enterprise. Thus
Waterford was several times attacked by the O&#8217;Driscolls, a
piratical clan in West Cork, who habitually allied themselves
with the Le Poers. In 1413 the citizens assumed the
offensive, and armed a ship, in which the mayor and bailiffs
with a strong band sailed to Baltimore, where they arrived on
Christmas Day. A messenger was sent to say that the Mayor
of Waterford had brought a cargo of wine, and admission was
thus gained to the chief&#8217;s hall. &#8216;The Mayor,&#8217; we are told,
&#8216;took up to dance O&#8217;Driscoll and his son, the prior of the
Friary, O&#8217;Driscoll&#8217;s three brethren, his uncle, and his wife,
and having them in their dance, the Mayor commanded every
of his men to hold fast the said persons; and so, after singing
a carol, came away bringing with them aboard the said
ship the said O&#8217;Driscoll and his company, saying unto them
they should go with him to Waterford to sing their carol and
make merry that Christmas; and they being all aboard
made sail presently, and arrived at Waterford, St. Stephen&#8217;s
day at night, where with great joy received they were with
lights.&#8217;</p>

<p>This exploit seems to have tamed the O&#8217;Driscolls for a
time, but they invaded Waterford in 1452 and 1461. On the
first occasion the citizens had the worst, but on the second
they gained the victory, and took the chief with six of his
sons.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry V.
makes
Talbot
Viceroy.</div>

<p>In the first year of his reign Henry V. made the famous
Sir John Talbot Viceroy. He was entitled to lands in Westmeath
in right of his wife, and the lordship of Wexford had
devolved upon his elder brother. He adopted the plan by
which Bellingham and Sidney afterwards reconquered the
greater part of Ireland. The array of the counties was called
out under heavy penalties, and Talbot remained six days in
Leix, which he so ravaged as to bring O&#8217;More to his senses.
The bridge of Athy, which had been of use to none but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
assailants of the Pale, was rebuilt and fortified, so that the
cattle of loyal people might graze in safety, which they had
not done for thirty years. Passes were cut in the woods
bordering on the settled districts, and there seemed some hope
for the shrunken and shattered colony. But Talbot&#8217;s salary
of 4,000 marks fell into arrear, and his unpaid soldiers
became a worse scourge than the Irish had been. The Viceroy
and his brother, the Archbishop of Dublin, were constantly
at daggers drawn with the White Earl of Ormonde, and the
feud continued nearly till the Earl&#8217;s death in 1450. It was,
however, due both to Sir John Talbot and to Ormonde, his
antagonist, that the Irish were kept at bay. Shakespeare&#8217;s
hero was the bugbear with which French mothers quieted
naughty children, and he was no less feared in Ireland.
With the colonists he was not popular, because the Crown
refused him the means of paying his debts, and Irish writers
stigmatise him as the worst man who had appeared in the
world since the time of Herod.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drain of
colonists
to the
English
civil wars.</div>

<p>&#8216;France,&#8217; says Sir John Davies, &#8216;was a fairer mark
to shoot at than Ireland, and could better reward the conqueror.&#8217;
The latter part of his statement is questionable,
but such was the view taken by the kings of England from
Henry II. to Henry VII. Thomas Butler, Prior of Kilmainham,
who ought to have been engaged in the defence
of the Pale, took 1,500 men to help Henry V. at the siege
of Rouen in 1418. The contemporary chronicler, Robert
Redman, says they did excellent service with very sharp
darts and crossbows. Trained in the irregular warfare of
Ireland, they easily outran the Frenchmen, to whom they
showed extraordinary animosity, but were less honourably
distinguished by their practice of kidnapping children and
selling them as slaves to the English. James, Earl of
Ormonde and Wiltshire, also raised troops in Ireland for
foreign service, and it is probable that many other contingents
were furnished of which no record has been preserved.
These forces consisted of Anglo-Irish, or at least of Irishmen
settled in obedient districts, and their absence from home
must have had a constant tendency to weaken the colony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard of
York made
Lord-Lieutenant
for ten
years, 1449.</div>

<p>In 1449 Richard of York visited Ireland as Viceroy. He
accepted the office for ten years, in consideration of 4,000
marks for the first, and 2,000<i>l.</i> for each succeeding year, and
of the whole local revenue. Richard was Earl of Ulster, but
he preferred conciliation to any attempt at reconquest, and
was, consequently, able to command the services of many
Irish clans, including Magennis, MacArtane, MacMahon, and
O&#8217;Reilly. The O&#8217;Byrnes were put down with the help of the
Northern chiefs, O&#8217;Neill himself sent presents to the Duke,
and most of the central districts became tributary. The
Anglo-Normans of Munster, who had partially degenerated,
renewed their allegiance, and it was generally supposed that
the task of making Ireland English would at last be accomplished.
The Viceroy&#8217;s son George, the &#8216;false, fleeting, perjured
Clarence,&#8217; of later years, was born in Dublin, and his
sponsors were Ormonde and Desmond. But very soon the
fair prospect was clouded. The stipulated salary was not paid.
The Irish discovered that Richard had no greater force than
his predecessors, and the MacGeohegans, who had submitted,
openly defied his power. He left Ireland suddenly in the
autumn of 1450, and did not return for nine years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard is
popular,
and creates
a Yorkist
party.
Ireland
almost independent.</div>

<p>Richard had not done much to increase the King&#8217;s power
in Ireland, but he created a Yorkist party there. At the
time he was accused of prompting Cade&#8217;s rebellion, and Jack
himself was said to be a native of Ireland. The fact that both
Simnel and Warbeck afterwards found their best support
among the Anglo-Irish seems to show that the Kildare and
Desmond partisans were already familiar with the notion of
a Yorkist pretender. It is very probable that the adherents
of the White Rose saw their opportunity in the fact that the
Earldom of Ulster belonged to their chief, and Cade must
have had an object in calling himself Mortimer. All this is
plausible conjecture; but about the significance of Richard&#8217;s
second viceroyalty there can be no reasonable doubt. In
1459, after Salisbury&#8217;s defeat at Blore Heath, the Duke of
York was forced to fly, and he took refuge in Ireland, where
he seized the government in spite of the Coventry Parliament.
The local independence of Ireland was now for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
seriously attempted. Richard held a Parliament, which
acknowledged the English Crown while repudiating the
English Legislature and the English Courts of Law. The
Duke of York&#8217;s person was declared inviolable, and rebellion
against him was made high treason. The royal privilege of
coining money was also given to him. William Overy, a
squire of the Earl of Ormonde, who was already acknowledged
as head of the Irish Lancastrians, attempted to arrest the
Duke as an attainted traitor and rebel; but he was seized,
tried before Richard himself, and hanged, drawn, and
quartered. After the victory of his friends at Northampton
the Duke returned to England. He took with him a considerable
body of Anglo-Irish partisans, and he committed
the government to the Earl of Kildare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Yorkist
faction
headed by
the Earl of
Kildare.</div>

<p>Richard of York fell at Sandal Hill, but the popularity
which he had gained in Ireland descended to his son. In the
bloody battle of Towton the flower of the Anglo-Irish Lancastrians
fell, and their leader, the Earl of Ormonde, was
taken and beheaded. His house suffered an eclipse from
which it was destined to emerge with greater brilliancy than
ever, and the rival family of Kildare became for a time
supreme in the Pale. The native Irish everywhere advanced,
and English law rapidly shrunk within the narrowest limits.
A Parliament, held by the Earl of Desmond in 1465, enacted
that every Irishman dwelling among the English in Dublin,
Meath, Louth, and Kildare, should dress in the English
fashion, shave his moustache, take the oath of allegiance
within a year, and assume as a surname the name of a town,
of a colour, or of a trade. In the Parliament of 1480, held by
the Earl of Kildare, all trade between the Pale and the Irish
was forbidden by law. The Parliament of Drogheda in 1468
had already passed an Act which declared that the castle of
Ballymore Eustace, &#8216;lying between the counties of Dublin
and Kildare, among the O&#8217;Byrnes and O&#8217;Tooles, Irish enemies,&#8217;
should be garrisoned by Englishmen only. The Eustaces, it
was explained, had given it in charge to &#8216;one Lawrence
O&#8217;Bogan, an Irishman both by father and mother, who by
nature would discover the secrets of the English.&#8217; Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Acts to a similar effect might be cited, and it may be said
that the main object of Edward IV.&#8217;s government in Ireland
was to separate the two races more completely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">George,
Duke of
Clarence,
twice
Viceroy.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Execution
of Thomas,
Earl of
Desmond,
1467.</div>

<p>George, Duke of Clarence, was Viceroy from 1461 to 1470,
and again from 1472 till his mysterious death in 1478.
Though born in Dublin, he never visited Ireland as a man,
and the government was administered by a succession of
Deputies. The fate of one of these Deputies, Thomas, eighth
Earl of Desmond, deserves particular mention. John Tiptoft,
Earl of Worcester, whose beautiful Latinity had moved Pope
Æneas Sylvius to tears, was entrusted with the government
in 1467, and he assembled a Parliament in which Desmond
and Kildare were attainted. Kildare escaped to England,
and procured a reversal of the attainder, but Desmond was enticed
to Drogheda, and there beheaded. The ostensible cause
for this severity is declared by an unpublished statute to have
been &#8216;alliance, fosterage, and alterage with the King&#8217;s Irish
enemies, and furnishing them with horses, harness, and arms,
and supporting them against the King&#8217;s loyal subjects.&#8217; The
Anglo-Irish tradition attributes it to the vengeance of Queen
Elizabeth Woodville, whose marriage Desmond had opposed.
According to Russell, he told Edward that Sir John Grey&#8217;s
widow was too mean a match for him, that he needed allies
sorely, and that he had better cast her off and link himself
with some powerful prince. By this account the Queen stole
the royal signet, and transmitted a secret order for the Earl&#8217;s
death to Ireland. Three years later Worcester was taken
and beheaded during the short Lancastrian restoration; and
this quite disposes of Russell&#8217;s statement that King Edward
&#8216;struck his head from his neck to make satisfaction to the
angry ghost of Desmond.&#8217; What is historically important in
Desmond&#8217;s execution is that it gave his successors an excuse
for not attending Parliaments or entering walled towns. Their
claim to legal exemption was not indeed allowed, but it may
have had considerable effect on their conduct.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

George and Richard, Viceroys, and Richard III. conferred the
same office on his infant son Edward. The government was
carried on by Deputies, and during the last twenty years of
the Yorkist dynasty almost all real power centred in the
House of Kildare. It was the seventh Earl who established
the brotherhood of St. George for the defence of the Pale.
The thirteen members of this fraternity were chosen from
among the principal landowners of the four obedient shires,
thus excluding the Butlers, who formed a small Pale of their
own about Kilkenny. The brothers of St. George had rather
more than 200 soldiers under them, who were paid out of
the royal revenue; and that constituted the entire standing
army. The cities and towns maintained a precarious existence
by themselves. In the charter which Richard III.
granted to Galway it was specially declared that the Clanricarde
Burkes had no jurisdiction within the town which their
ancestors had taken and fortified. An Act passed in 1485
declares that various benefices in the diocese of Dublin were
situated among the Irish, that English clerks could not serve
the churches because they could not be understood or because
they refused to reside, and that it was therefore necessary to
collate Irish clerks; and power was given to the Archbishop
to do so for two years. The statute of Kilkenny and the
Acts subsidiary to it had had their natural effect. The
English, in trying to become perfectly English, had shrunk
almost to nothing; and the Irish, by being held always at
arm&#8217;s length, had become more Irish and less civilised than
ever.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE IRISH PARLIAMENT.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">The Irish
Parliament
a close
copy.</div>

<p>The history of the Irish Parliament in the middle ages
corresponds pretty closely with that of England. The idea
of the three estates is plainly visible as early as 1204, when
John asked an aid from the archbishops, bishops, abbots,
priors, archdeacons, and clergy, the earls, barons, justices,
sheriffs, knights, citizens, burgesses, and freeholders of Ireland.
The Common Council of the King&#8217;s faithful of Ireland
is afterwards often mentioned, and in 1228 Henry III.
ordered his justiciary to convoke the archbishops, bishops,
abbots, priors, earls and barons, knights and freeholders,
and the bailiffs of every county, and to read Magna Charta
to them. 1254 has been fixed as the date at which two
knights from each shire were regularly summoned to the
English Parliament. In the confusion which followed, the
precedent slept for a while, but in Simon de Montfort&#8217;s
famous Parliament in 1264 burgesses as well as knights had
seats. The evidences of regular election in Ireland are scanty
at this early period; but legislative enactments and pecuniary
aids were more than once made by the whole community
of Ireland before the close of Henry III.&#8217;s reign. The germs
of a Parliamentary constitution were not planted in purely
Irish districts; but it is probable that ecclesiastics attended
Parliament even from them, and that the natives were thus
in some degree represented. In 1254 the King called by name
upon the Kings O&#8217;Donnell, O&#8217;Neill, O&#8217;Reilly, and O&#8217;Flynn, upon
MacCarthy of Desmond, O&#8217;Brien of Thomond, O&#8217;Phelan of
Decies, and fourteen other Celtic chiefs, to help him against
the Scots. He confides in their love for him to furnish such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
help, and promises them thanks; pointedly separating their
case from that of his lieges of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Growth of
representative
institutions.</div>

<p>Accepting 1295 as the date at which English Parliamentary
representation settled down into something like its modern
shape, we find that the great Plantagenet was not unmindful
of Ireland. In that same year the justiciary Wogan issued
writs to the prelates and nobles, and also to the sheriffs
of Dublin, Louth, Kildare, Waterford, Tipperary, Cork,
Limerick, Kerry, Connaught, and Roscommon, and to the
seneschals of the liberties of Meath, Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny,
and Ulster. The sheriffs and seneschals were ordered
to proceed to the election of two good and discreet knights
from each county or liberty, who were to have full power to
act for their districts. It does not appear that cities and
boroughs were represented on this occasion; but in 1300,
Wogan being still justiciary, writs were directed to counties
for the election of three or four members, and to cities and
boroughs for the election of two or three. The King&#8217;s
principal object was to get money for his Scotch war; and,
with this view, Wogan visited Drogheda and other places
and extorted benevolence before the Parliament met. A
certain supremacy was not denied to the English Parliament,
for in 1290 a vast number of petitions were made to the
King in Parliament at Westminster. Among the petitioners
was the Viceroy, John Sandford, Archbishop of Dublin,
who begged the King to consider the state of Ireland, of
which he had already advised him through Geoffrey de
Joinville, a former Viceroy, who was sitting in Parliament
with others of the King&#8217;s Council in Ireland. Edward I.
answered that he was very busy, but that he had the matter
much at heart, and that he would attend to it as soon as he
could.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of 1295.</div>

<p>Of the Parliament of 1295 a particular record has fortunately
been preserved. Each sheriff was ordered to make
his election in the full county court, and each seneschal in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the full court of the liberty, and they were to attend Parliament
in their proper persons&mdash;to verify the returns no
doubt. The personal attendance of the sheriffs was required
in England until 1406. The magnates who were summoned
to Wogan&#8217;s Parliament behaved as we might expect to find
them behave. The Bishops of the South and East came. The
Archbishop of Armagh and his suffragans sent proctors with
excuses for non-attendance. The Archbishop of Tuam and
his suffragans neither came nor apologised. The absence of
Hugo de Lacy, one of those elected by the county of Limerick,
is particularly noted, whence we may infer that the other
shires and liberties were duly represented. Richard, Earl of
Ulster, was present. This Parliament principally occupied
itself with making regulations as to the treatment of the
Irish, and in devising means for checking their inroads upon
the colonised districts. The descendants of the first conquerors
were already beginning to adopt Celtic customs.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliaments
of
Edward II.
and Edward
III.</div>

<p>Under Edward II. Parliaments were frequent; and writs
are extant which show that he, as well as Edward III., intended
them to be held annually. Cases occur of bishops,
priors, and temporal peers being fined for non-attendance in
this reign, and there is good reason to believe that those who
were summoned to Parliament generally came. In 1311
writs for a Parliament to be held at Kilkenny were issued by
the justiciary Wogan to Richard, Earl of Ulster, and eighty-seven
other men of name, to the prelates and ecclesiastical
magnates, and to the sheriffs. The sheriffs were ordered to
summon two knights from every county, and two citizens or
burgesses from every city or borough, who were to have full
power to act for their several communities in conjunction
with the magnates, lay and clerical. Owing probably to the
shape which Bruce&#8217;s invasion gave to the English colony, the
Parliaments of Edward III. are more strictly confined to the
districts where the King had real as well as nominal authority.
The murder of the last Earl of Ulster in 1333, and the conversion
of the De Burghs into Irishmen, almost completed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the work of destruction which Bruce had only just failed to
effect. To the Parliament of 1360, the Archbishops of
Dublin and Cashel, the Bishops of Meath, Kildare, Lismore,
Killaloe, Limerick, Emly, Cloyne, and Ferns, and the Abbots
of St. Mary&#8217;s and St. Thomas&#8217;s at Dublin were the only prelates
summoned. The Earls of Kildare and Desmond and
eight knights were called up by name. Writs for the election
of two knights were issued to the sheriffs of the counties of
Dublin, Carlow, Louth, Kildare, Waterford, Limerick, and
Cork, and of the crosses of Meath, Kilkenny, Wexford, and
Tipperary; and to the seneschals of the liberties of Kilkenny,
Meath, Tipperary, and Wexford. Writs for the election of
citizens and burgesses were no longer directed to the sheriffs,
but the mayor and bailiffs of Dublin, Drogheda, Cork, Waterford,
and Limerick, the sovereign and bailiffs of Kilkenny and
Ross, and the provost and bailiffs of Clonmel and Wexford were
ordered to return two members each. The sheriff of Kildare
and the seneschal of the liberty of Kilkenny were told what
individuals they were expected to see elected. The House
of Commons was then supposed to consist of twenty-eight
knights and twenty-four citizens and burgesses; but the
counties of Dublin and Carlow were &#8216;justly excused&#8217; on
account of the war, and the members for Drogheda, who
omitted to come, were summoned before the Council under
a penalty of 40<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of Kilkenny.</div>

<p>The famous Parliament which Lionel, Duke of Clarence,
held at Kilkenny in 1367 was probably attended by representatives
from a very limited district; for there were but
forty members of the House of Commons in March 1374, and
of these four came from the county of Dublin. But in
November 1374 the number was fifty-four; in 1377 it rose
to sixty-two; and in 1380 and 1382 it was fifty-eight. We
may, therefore, take the number of county and borough
members at the close of the fourteenth century as about sixty.
The counties generally represented were Dublin, Kildare,
Carlow, Meath, Louth, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, and Wex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>ford,
the liberties of Ulster, Meath, Tipperary, Kerry, and
Kilkenny, and the crosses of Ulster, Tipperary, Kilkenny, and
Kerry. The cities were Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Kilkenny,
and Limerick, and the towns were Drogheda, Youghal, Ross,
Wexford, Galway, and Athenry. Longford was a county in
1377, but was not maintained as shire ground. Many Parliaments
met during the fifteenth century, but their action was
more and more confined to the district round Dublin, which
about the middle of the century came to be called the Pale.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Hereditary
peers.</div>

<p>1295 will probably be accepted as the date when English
barons who had once sat in Parliament claimed an hereditary
right to their writs of summons. It would seem that the origin
of the Irish peerage, using the word in its modern sense, must
be referred to a somewhat later date; for eighty-seven persons,
who were perhaps all tenants of the Crown, were summoned
by name to the Kilkenny Parliament in 1311. The subject
is not of great historical importance, because the period of
transition coincides with that in which the encroachments of
the natives reduced feudal Ireland to its lowest estate. In
the sixteenth century the title of baron was still popularly
given to the heads of some families who had formerly been
barons by tenure, but who had lost all Parliamentary rights.
As in England, the knights of the shire had become the
proper representatives of the gentry, and peerage grew to be
the special creation of the Crown. In the Parliament of
1560 there were twenty-three temporal peers, and of these
eight had been created within the century. It will be safe
to assume that the number of temporal peers sitting in the
Irish Parliament at any time during the one hundred years
preceding Elizabeth&#8217;s accession was well under thirty.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Spiritual
peers.</div>

<p>The number of spiritual greatly exceeded the number of
temporal peers. There were four archbishops from the first
sending of the palls in 1151. If we take the year 1500, after
some unions had been effected and before the great quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
between King and Pope, we find that there were twenty-six
bishops in Ireland. Some of the more distant ones were
perhaps never summoned to Parliament, and long before the
close of the fifteenth century we cannot doubt that many had
ceased to attend the shrunken legislature of the Pale. In 1293
John, Bishop of Clonfert, an Italian and the Pope&#8217;s nuncio,
was fined for non-attendance; and similar penalties were imposed
on Bishops of Ferns, Ossory, Cork, Ardfert, Limerick,
Down, and Emly, during the reigns of Edward II., Edward
III., and Richard II. There were thirteen mitred Abbots of
the Cistercian order, ten mitred Priors of Augustinian canons;
and the Grand Prior of Kilmainham, who represented the
wealth and importance of the proscribed Templars as well as
of the Hospitallers, had always a seat in Parliament. The
Prior of Kilmainham was so important a person that upon
the suppression of the order of St. John, Henry VIII. made
its last chief a peer. The Abbot of St. Mary&#8217;s and the Prior
of St. Thomas&#8217;s were always summoned, but it is clear that
in earlier days all the mitred heads of houses were considered
real as well as nominal spiritual peers. The Prior of Athassel
was fined for non-attendance in 1323, the Abbot of Owney in
1325, and the Abbot of Jerpoint in 1377. Much obscurity
hangs over the mediæval House of Lords in Ireland; but it
must generally have rested with the Viceroy whether the
temporal or spiritual peers should be most numerous in any
particular Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The clergy
as a separate
estate.
Proctors.</div>

<p>The existence of the clergy as a separate estate in Ireland
is less clear than in England; but they had the right of
taxing themselves, for in 1538 the Lords Spiritual were
thanked by Henry VIII. for granting him an annual
twentieth of all their promotions, benefices, and possessions.
Proctors of the clergy attended the Lower House, and when
Henry VIII. undertook his ecclesiastical innovations, they
claimed the right to veto bills. It was, however, easily shown
that their consent had not formerly been held necessary;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and in 1537 an Act was passed declaring the proctors to
be no members of Parliament. The preamble states that
two proctors from each diocese had been usually summoned
to attend Parliament; but that they had neither voice nor
vote, and were only &#8216;counsellors and assistants upon such
things of learning as should happen in controversy to declare
their opinions, much like as the Convocation within the
realm of England.&#8217; Their pretensions to a veto were formally
pronounced baseless, and it was declared once for all that the
assent or dissent of the proctors could have no effect on the
action of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Viceroy.</div>

<p>The representative of the King in Ireland was generally
styled justiciar for a long time after the first invasion. His
powers were analogous to that of the great officer of State in
England who had the same title, and who acted as regent
during the frequent absences of the kings. The title of
justiciar continued to be given to the Irish viceroys long
after the English justiciarship changed its character&mdash;that
is, about the close of Henry III.&#8217;s reign. The first person
who had the title of Lord Lieutenant, if we except the early
case of John de Courcy, appears to have been Lionel, Earl of
Ulster and Duke of Clarence, who was sent to Ireland in 1361.
Afterwards it became a common practice to make one of the
royal family Lord Lieutenant, the duties being usually performed
by a deputy. But the title of Lord Lieutenant,
though considered higher than any other, was not confined
to princes. In time the title of Deputy was given to Governors
of Ireland, even when no Lord Lieutenant intervened
between them and the King. Richard of York was the last
Lord Lieutenant of royal blood who actually ruled at Dublin.
After his time the real government was in the hands of the
Earls of Kildare, who were Lords Deputy, with but brief
intervals, from 1478 to 1526. During that period the title
of Lord Lieutenant, but the title only, was enjoyed by
Edward, Prince of Wales, by John de la Pole, Earl of
Lincoln, by Jasper, Duke of Bedford, and by Henry VIII.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
before his accession to the Crown. In the meantime, the
word justiciar, or Lord Justice, had come to mean a temporary
substitute for the Deputy or Lieutenant. When a sovereign
died, or when a viceroy suddenly left Ireland, it became the
business of the Council to elect some one in his room. When
giving leave to a governor to leave his post, the sovereign
sometimes named the Lord Justice. Lord Capel, who was
appointed in 1695, was the last chief governor who had the
title of Deputy. Since the Revolution, the head of the Irish
Government has always been a Lord Lieutenant, and during
his absence one, or two, or three Lords Justices have been
appointed by the Irish Privy Council.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE REIGN OF HENRY VII.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Accession
of Henry
VII., 1485.</div>

<p>Ireland was destined to give the victor of Bosworth much
trouble, but his accession made little immediate difference
to the Anglo-Irish community. Kildare continued to act
as Chief Governor, and on the nomination of Jasper, Duke
of Bedford, to the Lord Lieutenancy, he was formally appointed
Deputy under him. His brother Thomas was
allowed to retain the Great Seal. While thus leaving the
administration of the island to the Yorkist Geraldines, Henry
lost no time in restoring the rival House, which had suffered
in defence of the Red Rose. Sir Thomas Butler was by
Act of Parliament at once restored in blood, became seventh
Earl of Ormonde, and was taken into high favour. The
practical leadership of the Irish Butlers was, however, never
held by him, and the disputes concerning it had no doubt
great effect in consolidating Kildare&#8217;s power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ormonde
family.
Sir Piers
Butler.</div>

<p>John, sixth Earl of Ormonde, who never lived in Ireland,
appointed as his deputy his cousin, Sir Edmund Butler.
Earl John dying in Palestine, his brother Thomas succeeded
him, and continued Sir Edmund in the custody of the Irish
estates. Sir Edmund by will granted to his son Piers the
same power as he had himself held, but it does not appear
that this curious bequest was acknowledged either by the
Earl of Ormonde or by the people of Kilkenny and Tipperary.
Sir James Ormonde, as he is called, a bastard son of the fifth
Earl, became the real chief of the Butlers, and is often called
Earl by Irish writers; the rules of legitimate descent being
then very lightly regarded in Ireland. Sir James received a
regular commission from Thomas, Earl of Ormonde, as his
deputy, supervisor, &#8216;and general and special attorney&#8217; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Kilkenny. Strong in the confidence of the rightful Earl and
in the estimation of the people, Sir James became Kildare&#8217;s
chief opponent; who to weaken him espoused the cause of
Sir Piers, to whom he gave his daughter Lady Margaret in
marriage. &#8216;By that means and policy,&#8217; says the &#8216;Book of
Howth,&#8217; &#8216;the Earl of Wormond (<i>i.e.</i> Sir James) was so occupied
in his own country that he could not attend to do
any damage to the Earl of Kildare nor any of his friends.&#8217;
And the chronicler Stanihurst, a Geraldine partisan, would
have us believe that the successful career of Sir Piers was
wholly due to the &#8216;singular wisdom&#8217; of his wife. An eminent
modern antiquary tells us that her fame still lives among
the peasantry of Kilkenny, while the Red Earl is forgotten;
that she is remembered as Magheen, or little Margaret, and
that she is the traditional castle-builder of the district.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare
suspected
of plots.
Lambert
Simnel.</div>

<p>It has been generally stated that Henry, before he had
been a year on the throne, heard that Kildare was plotting
against him. From what happened later, it is likely that
such a report would not have been without foundation.
Perhaps there was some evidence of his complicity in Lord
Lovel&#8217;s abortive insurrection, and it is highly probable that
he was a party to the plot which the Duchess of Burgundy
was hatching against the King of England.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Except on the
supposition that he had already been admitted to the conspirator&#8217;s
confidence, it is hard to see how Kildare can have
received Lambert Simnel and his promoter, a young and
undistinguished priest, without hesitation or inquiry. There
was no Lancastrian party in Dublin, and Henry&#8217;s politic
exhibition of the real Earl of Warwick had no effect upon
men who were determined to accept the counterfeit. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
common with almost every temporal grandee, the Archbishop
of Dublin and the Bishops of Meath and Kildare espoused
the pretender&#8217;s cause; but Octavian, Archbishop of Armagh,
a Florentine, and well informed, remained firm, and was
supported by the Bishop of Clogher. Henry afterwards
asked the Pope to excommunicate the prelates who had
favoured the pretender, and it is remarkable that he mentions
the Archbishop of Armagh as one of them. Among the
temporal peers, Lord Howth had the sense to see that Henry
would be victorious, and he kept him well informed of all
that went on in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Simnel is
crowned
King.</div>

<p>Simnel remained in Ireland, and published acts were
done in his name as King until the arrival of Lincoln and
Lovel, with Martin Swart, an experienced German leader,
and 2,000 veterans of his nation, sent by Margaret of
Burgundy. Lambert was crowned in Christ Church with
a diadem borrowed for the occasion from a statue of the
Virgin, and was shown to the people borne aloft on the
shoulders of Darcy of Platten, the tallest man of his time&mdash;details
which bespeak the poverty of the country. A coronation
sermon was preached by the Bishop of Meath.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Kildare ordered the citizens of Waterford to join him
with all their forces, but the mayor, who was a Butler, filled
the town with the vassals of the House of Ormonde, and the
clans depending on it, and returned for answer that they held
all as traitors who had taken any part in the mock coronation.
Kildare hanged the poor groom who had brought this
message, an act of barbarity with which the Archbishop was
much offended, and then repeated his summons. The herald,
who bore the Geraldine arms on his tabard, was refused admission
to Waterford, and summoned the citizens from a boat,
ordering them instantly to proclaim King Edward VI. on
pain of being hanged at their own doors. With becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
spirit the chief magistrate replied, that they would not give
the Earl so much trouble, that they looked on all his partisans
as traitors, and that they were ready to give him battle
thirty miles away. Kilkenny, Clonmel, Callan, Fethard, and
other towns followed the example of Waterford.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of
Stoke, 1487.</div>

<p>There was some division of opinion between the partisans
of Simnel as to whether England should be immediately
invaded. Two reasons in favour of this course prevailed over
those for establishing a separate government in Ireland.
The country was too poor to support 2,000 German mercenaries,
and the Irish followers of Kildare, who cared little
for either rose, promised themselves much pleasure from
fighting and plundering in hated England. Accordingly,
just a month after the mock coronation, Lambert and his
friends left Dublin and landed at Foudray in Lancashire,
where they were joined by Sir Thomas Broughton and some
of his tenants. &#8216;But their snowball,&#8217; in Bacon&#8217;s phrase, &#8216;did
not gather as they went,&#8217; and they advanced as far as Newark
without materially increasing their force. The popularity
which Henry had gained during his late stay at York, and
the general pardon which he had given, went far to break up
the Yorkist party in the North, &#8216;and it was an odious thing
to Englishmen to have a King brought in to them upon the
shoulders of Irish and Dutch.&#8217; At Stoke, the pretender&#8217;s
motley host came into collision with the far more numerous
royal army. The Germans fought well, and so did their
few English allies; &#8216;neither did the Irish fail in courage or
fierceness, but being almost naked men, only armed with
darts and skeans, it was rather an execution than a fight
upon them.&#8217; At least 4,000 of the pseudo-Yorkists fell,
including Martin Swart, the Earl of Lincoln, and Kildare&#8217;s
brother, the Irish Chancellor, Thomas Fitzgerald. Lord
Lovel and Sir Thomas Broughton may have escaped for a
time, but they were never heard of again. It appears from
a passage in the &#8216;Annals of Ulster,&#8217; where Henry VII. is contemptuously
mentioned as &#8216;the son of a Welshman,&#8217; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the native Irish believed Simnel to be what he pretended to
be&mdash;the last prince of the blood royal.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Loyalty of
Waterford.</div>

<p>The loyalty of Waterford deserved special thanks, and
Henry sent a letter to the mayor and citizens, in which he
expressed his hearty gratitude. To show his perfect confidence
he commanded them to pursue and harass the Earl of
Kildare and the citizens of Dublin, both by sea and land.
The trade of the Irish capital was placed at their mercy, and
they were exhorted not to desist from hostilities until &#8216;our
rebel, the Earl of Kildare,&#8217;&mdash;who was also our Deputy&mdash;and
his Dublin allies were brought to due obedience. Kildare
sent messengers to England to make his peace, and the citizens
of Dublin did likewise. &#8216;We were daunted,&#8217; said the
latter plausibly enough, &#8216;to see not only the chief governor,
whom your Highness made ruler over us, to bend or bow to
that idol whom they made us to obey, but also our Father of
Dublin, and most of the clergy of the nation.&#8217; After some
hesitation, Henry resolved to pardon all the Irish conspirators,
and even allowed Kildare to remain in the office of Deputy.
In return for their pardons the nobility were required to take
the oath of allegiance; and to secure its proper administration
the King resolved to send a special commissioner to
Ireland. Sir Richard Edgcombe, Controller of the Household,
whom he had already employed on a diplomatic mission to
Scotland, was the person chosen for this delicate duty.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mission of
Sir Richard
Edgcombe,
1488.</div>

<p>Sir Richard sailed from Fowey with a squadron of four
vessels containing 500 men; and having tried in vain among
the Scilly Islands and in the Bristol Channel to surprise
certain pirates who infested those seas, he reached Kinsale on
the fifth day, where he again failed to apprehend a notable
pirate. Lord Barry Oge came on board to take the oath
of allegiance. Edgcombe then landed, was met by Lord
Courcy and the townsmen of Kinsale, received the keys of
the town, and administered the oath to all persons of import<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>ance.
Having granted a royal pardon, he sailed for Waterford,
where he was loyally welcomed. Hearing that he had
brought a pardon for Kildare, the citizens reminded him that
the Earl was their bitterest enemy, and begged to be exempted
from any jurisdiction which he or any other Irish lord might
claim as Deputy. Sir Richard promised to advance the interests
of Waterford at Court, and then went on to Dublin.
Kildare kept the royal commissioner waiting for eight days,
during part of which time he was entertained at Malahide,
by a lady of the Talbot family. At last the Earl came to
Thomas Court with 200 horse, and sent the Bishop of Meath
and the Baron of Slane to conduct Sir Richard thither. On
entering the room Edgcombe made no bow to the Lord
Deputy, but bluntly delivered the King&#8217;s letters. Five days
more were given for the rest of the lords to make an appearance,
and Kildare retired to Maynooth to digest the letters
and verbal messages. On the fourth day Sir Richard came
by pressing invitation to Maynooth, and the Earl promised
that he would do everything required of him; but he continued
to interpose delays in coming to any official decision.
Sharply reprimanded by the royal commissioner, the lords at
last agreed to take the oath of allegiance; but refused to
enter into recognisances for the forfeiture of their estates in
case they should again lapse from their duty, plainly declaring
that they would rather become Irishmen, every one of them.
With an oath of allegiance Sir Richard was fain to be content,
and he drew one in very stringent form, Henry being
specially described as the &#8216;natural and right-wise&#8217; King of
England. To prevent tricks, the host, upon which the oath
was taken, was consecrated by Edgcombe&#8217;s own chaplain. The
nobility present, and the principal ecclesiastical dignitaries
about Dublin, were sworn or did homage, and particularly
bound themselves to support and execute the censures of the
Church, as pronounced by the Bull of Innocent VIII. upon
those who should rebel against the King of England. In
that instrument the Pope had declared his belief that the
Crown belonged to Henry by inheritance, by conquest, and
by election, independently of, and in addition to his claim in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
right of Elizabeth of York. Among the commoners whom
it was thought necessary to swear specially was Darcy of
Platten, the tall man who had borne Lambert on his shoulders.
The civic authorities of Dublin, Drogheda, and Trim, having
been sworn before him in their own towns, Sir Richard
embarked at Dalkey on the thirty-fourth day after his arrival
at Kinsale. Of all Simnel&#8217;s partisans, Keating, Prior
of Kilmainham, was the only one who did not receive a
pardon.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Irish

<p>Kildare sent the Bishop of Meath to England to watch
his interests, and Octavian also sent an agent to procure for
him the custody of the Great Seal. The Primate complained
that Kildare, despite his recent oath, had begun plotting
against him before Edgcombe had reached the English shore.
&#8216;I know,&#8217; he said, &#8216;for certain that if the said Earl of Kildare
obtains the government of Ireland by royal authority,
and has the Chancellor of Ireland also at his back, that I have
no hope of quiet in Ireland.&#8217; Henry did not give the seal to
the Archbishop, but he summoned all the Irish nobility to
Court; and all obeyed except Desmond and Fitzmaurice of
Kerry. &#8216;My masters of Ireland,&#8217; said the King, when giving
them audience, &#8216;you will crown apes at length.&#8217; Afterwards
at dinner he gave point to this remark by ordering Lambert
Simnel to hand wine to those who had so lately crowned him
King. &#8216;None would have taken the cup out of his hand, but
bade the great devil of hell him take, before that ever they
saw him.&#8217; &#8216;Bring me the cup if the wine be good,&#8217; said the
Lord of Howth, being a merry gentleman, &#8216;and I shall drink
it off for the wine&#8217;s sake, and mine own sake also, and for
thee, as thou art, so I leave thee, a poor innocent.&#8217; Henry
kept the lords at Court long enough for them to feel the expense
burdensome, and then despatched them, making Lord
Howth, who had alone remained loyal, a present of 300<i>l.</i> in
gold, and the robe which he wore at the reception. Some
of the others had expected little less than the axe for their
reward.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

Butlers
and Geraldines.</div>

<p>The influence of Kildare was not much shaken by his
complicity in Simnel&#8217;s adventure, and it was not till 1492 that
he was deprived of the office of Deputy. It was conferred
on Walter Fitz-Simons, Archbishop of Dublin. About the
same time Rowland Fitz-Eustace, Baron of Portlester, the
Earl&#8217;s uncle, who had been Lord Treasurer for thirty-eight
years, was suddenly removed and threatened with a hostile
inquiry into his accounts during the whole period. Sir
James Ormonde, knighted by Henry in person, for his services
against Lambert, was appointed in his room, and another
Butler was made Master of the Rolls. The quarrel between
the two Houses blazed up fiercely; and Kildare, to reassert
his influence, summoned a great meeting of citizens on
Oxmantown Green.</p>

<p>The two factions came to blows, some lives were lost, and
Kildare attempted to seize the city by a sudden movement.
The gates were, however, shut in time; but Ship Street, then
outside the walls, was burned. The Geraldines wasted the
Butler territory, and the Butlers in their turn ravaged Kildare
and encamped in great force on the southern side of
Dublin. A meeting of the two chiefs in St. Patrick&#8217;s
Cathedral was then arranged. A riot took place in the
church, a flight of arrows was discharged, and Sir James,
suspecting treason, barred himself into the Chapter-house.
The Earl came to the door with offers of peace, and a hole
was cut in the timber through which the rivals might shake
hands. Sir James hesitated to risk his hand, but Kildare
settled the question by putting in his own. The door was
then opened, they embraced each other, and peace followed
for a time. To make amends for the desecration of the
church, the Pope ordered that the mayor should go barefoot
through the city on Corpus Christi day, and this practice
was continued till the Reformation. The door with the hole

lands 1491,
but leaves
the next
year.</div>

<p>&#8216;Ireland at this time,&#8217; says Ware, &#8216;was as it were a
theatre or stage on which masked princes entered, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
soon after, their visors being taken off, they were expulsed
the stage.&#8217; Perkin Warbeck landed at Cork late in 1491,
or early in 1492, and was entertained by John Walters, an
eminent merchant and future mayor. The citizens from the
beginning insisted on regarding him as a royal personage,
first as a son of Clarence, afterwards as a bastard of Richard
III., and finally as Richard, Duke of York, Edward IV.&#8217;s
younger son. Having adopted the latter character, Perkin
wrote letters, extant in Ware&#8217;s time, in which he sought
help from the Earls of Desmond and Kildare. The former
at once espoused his cause; the latter, according to his own
account, would have nothing to do with &#8216;the French lad.&#8217;
Desmond joined Perkin in soliciting the aid of James IV.
of Scotland, and he remained for about a year at Cork, learning
English, but apparently without exciting any anxiety
in England. Towards the close of 1492 he withdrew to
France, where Charles VIII. received him as a prince, and
where he was joined by disaffected Yorkists. Henry having
made a successful campaign in France, Perkin was dismissed
and went to Flanders, where Margaret of Burgundy acknowledged
him as her nephew, and no doubt instructed him how
to fill the part.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of 1493.</div>

<p>In 1493 the Archbishop of Dublin held a Parliament,
where many things were done unfavourable to the Geraldine
faction; and on August 12, John Walters and other
accomplices of the pretender were summoned to surrender.
The Archbishop shortly went over to England, where he
made Henry clearly acquainted with the state of affairs in
Ireland, and was followed by Kildare, who had an opportunity
of telling his own story. In consequence of what he had
learned, the King resolved to appoint a Deputy unconnected
with any Irish party; and fixed upon Sir Edward Poynings,
whom he had already employed as envoy to the Archduke
Philip, when remonstrating against the countenance given
to Perkin in Flanders. While Archbishop Fitz-Simons was
in England, Viscount Gormanston filled the office of Deputy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and even ventured to summons a Parliament; but the Duke
of Bedford having in the meantime resigned the lieutenancy,
his substitute&#8217;s action was afterwards declared null and void.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Edward
Poynings
Deputy,
1494.</div>

<p>Poynings landed at Howth on October 13, 1494, with
1,000 men. He was accompanied by Henry Dean, Bishop
of Bangor and afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, as
Chancellor, by Sir Hugh Conway as Treasurer, and by three
other Englishmen appointed to the chief places in the three
common law courts. Joining his forces with those of Kildare
and of Sir James Ormonde, Poynings immediately undertook
an expedition to Ulster, with a view of chastising O&#8217;Donnell,
who had lately been honourably received in Scotland, and
was probably implicated in Perkin&#8217;s project. When the
army reached O&#8217;Hanlon&#8217;s county, Sir James Ormonde persuaded
the Deputy that Kildare was plotting with the Irish
against his life, and some colour was given to the charge by
the conduct of the Earl&#8217;s brother James, who seized Carlow
Castle, mounted the Geraldine banner, and refused to
surrender when summoned in the King&#8217;s name. Having
with difficulty reduced Carlow, Poynings repaired to Drogheda,
where he held a Parliament, whose legislation was
destined to have a momentous effect on Irish history. The
invasion of Ulster was abandoned, and Bacon, with the
experience of the next century, summarily disposes of it as
&#8216;a wild chase on the wild Irish.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of Drogheda,
1494.</div>

<p>The Acts of this Parliament of 1494 are numerous, many
of them being intended to make the administration more
directly dependent on the Crown. Thus, the judges and
other high officials were made to hold at the King&#8217;s pleasure,
instead of by patent as had been customary heretofore. It
was made illegal for great men to retain free citizens and
burgesses in their pay, or for anyone to make war without
the governor&#8217;s licence, or for anyone to stir up the Irish
against the English. It was made unlawful to keep firearms
without the Deputy&#8217;s licence. The Statutes of Kilkenny
were confirmed or re-enacted, with the exception of those
against using the Irish language and those obliging every
subject to ride in a saddle. Family war cries, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
&#8216;Butleraboo&#8217; and &#8216;Cromaboo,&#8217; were strictly prohibited. Coyne
and livery were visited with severe penalties; but advantageous
terms were fixed, upon which the King might obtain
provisions for his soldiers. All Acts against papal provisions
theretofore made, either in England or Ireland, were declared
to be in full force, though the Government had no
means whatever of preventing them, or of making other
arrangements for the vast majority of Irish benefices.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Poynings&#8217;
Acts.</div>

<p>The statutes known in after days as Poynings&#8217; Acts
were two in number. By the first it was enacted that no
future Parliaments should be held in Ireland, &#8216;but at such
season as the King&#8217;s Lieutenant and Council there first do
certify the King under the great seal of that land (Ireland),
the causes and considerations, and all such acts as them
seemeth should pass in the same Parliament.&#8217; Should the
King in Council approve them, then the Irish Parliament
should be summoned under the great seal of England, and not
otherwise. By the second Act it was provided that all public
statutes &#8216;late made within the said realm of England&#8217; should
be in force in Ireland. The lawyers decided that this applied
to all English Acts prior to the tenth year of Henry VII.
And thus the dependence of the Irish Parliament on that of
England was established in the fullest degree.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attainder
of Kildare.</div>

<p>Kildare was attainted by the Drogheda Parliament, the
Act stating that he had provoked Irish enemies and English
rebels to levy war against the King, that he had conspired
with O&#8217;Hanlon to kill the Deputy, that he had caused his
brother James to seize Carlow and hold it against the King,
that he had used coyne and livery, and that he had conspired
with the King of Scots and the Earl of Desmond for an
invasion of Ireland. The Earl was arrested and sent to
England, there to await Henry&#8217;s own judgment on these
and other matters. The chief of the southern Geraldines
had in the meantime again given his adhesion to the cause
of Perkin Warbeck.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

visit of
Perkin
Warbeck.
Siege of
Waterford,
1495.</div>

<p>Less than three weeks after his disgraceful failure in
Kent, Perkin was with Desmond in Munster. Eleven ships,
of which some were Scotch, attacked Waterford from the
river, while Desmond and his Irish allies with 2,400 men
threatened the city from the southern side. Poynings
marched against the invaders in person; but the real work
was done by the mayor and citizens, who dammed the stream
called John&#8217;s River, so as to prevent Desmond from joining
Perkin: while they battered the fleet with cannon planted
on Reginald&#8217;s Tower. They made several sallies, killed their
prisoners, and stuck their heads on stakes in the market-place.
When the siege had lasted eleven days one of
Perkin&#8217;s ships was sunk by the fire from the town, and the
adventurer then fled precipitately. At least three vessels
fell into the hands of the besieged or their allies, and the
citizens followed Perkin to Cork, where his friends protected
him. Afterwards he made his way to Scotland, where James
IV. received him with the honours due to a prince, and gave
him the hand of his cousin, Lady Catherine Gordon. James,
who was of an ambitious and visionary turn of mind, may
perhaps have thought it possible to restore the days of Bruce,
and to conquer some part of Ireland for himself. Two successive
O&#8217;Donnells acknowledged themselves his subjects,
and with their help and that of sailors like the Bartons,
Scotland might have disputed with England the possession
of Northern Ireland at least. The elder Hugh O&#8217;Donnell,
who died in 1505, was a man of considerable ability, the
annalists, with their usual magniloquence, styling him the
&#8216;Augustus of the North of Europe;&#8217; and with more truth
asserting that he was the most powerful person in the North
of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Poynings
leaves Ireland,
1496.</div>

<p>Poynings quitted Ireland in January 1496, leaving the
government in the Bishop of Bangor&#8217;s hands. Important as
was the recent legislation, it cannot be said that Henry had
made any real change in the system of government. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
great idea, like that of his descendants, was to make Ireland
pay her own expenses, and for that purpose he sent over two
able officers, with instructions to overhaul the entire system
of government. Plenty of zeal seems to have been shown,
but the result was not encouraging. No year passed in Ireland
without some small war, and the established custom of
hiring native mercenaries tended to prevent any improvement.
Sir James Ormonde and other leaders found their account in
constant disturbance, and expense always more than kept
pace with revenue.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Friars employed
by
the Government.</div>

<p>The accounts of Vice-Treasurer Hattecliffe, to whom Henry
committed the control of Irish finance, seem to show that
Poynings and others found a difficulty in obtaining the aid of
subordinate officers. They had, however, a resource which
Elizabeth lacked, in the power of employing priests and
friars. Thus we find a Franciscan of Dublin sent to spy out
the manners of the people inhabiting the marches of the Pale,
and again acting as a messenger between the Council in
Dublin and the Deputy in the field. A canon named John
Staunton was sent to act as a spy &#8216;in Munster and elsewhere
about the Earl of Desmond, Perkin Warbeck, and other
rebels.&#8217; On another occasion a Carmelite was the means of
communication between the Government and Sir James
Ormonde, and it is probable that many more of the messengers
were clergymen, though the fact is not so mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Turbulence
of the
Geraldines.
Restoration
of Kildare,
1496.</div>

<p>That there was no peace, and consequently no diminution
of expense, is not to be altogether attributed to the rapacity
of Sir James Ormonde and other leaders of kerne and gallowglasses.
The Geraldines took care that the country should be
disturbed during the Earl&#8217;s absence, as we find by the following
significant entry:&mdash;&#8216;Two shillings to Philip Messanger
for carrying the Lord Justice&#8217;s letters directed to Richard
Paynteneye of Carbury, Edward Dowdall of Slane, to the
sovereign of Athboy, and others, ordering them to have sundry
fires made on sundry mountains&mdash;viz. the mountains of Tara,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Lyons, Athboy, and Slane, to warn the King&#8217;s lieges in case
James, the Earl&#8217;s son, and others the King&#8217;s Irish enemies,
should bring a power to invade the English districts.&#8217;
Several other payments were made to the same messenger for
services in connection with these Geraldine inroads, and
Henry came gradually to think that Kildare did more harm
as a prisoner than he could possibly do if he were at liberty.
Whether the account of the Earl&#8217;s behaviour at Court, which
has been copied from the &#8216;Book of Howth&#8217; into most histories,
be true or not, there can be little doubt that Henry thought
it better that he should rule all Ireland, than that he should
have further opportunities of showing that all Ireland could
not rule him. The gravest charge against him was that of
conspiring with O&#8217;Hanlon to murder Poynings, and this was
disposed of by the evidence of O&#8217;Hanlon. Prince Henry
became titular Lord-Lieutenant, the attainder was reversed
by the English Parliament, and Kildare received a commission
as Lord Deputy under the King&#8217;s son. His first wife, Alison
Eustace, is said to have died through the agitation caused
by his imprisonment, and he now added to his influence by
marrying Elizabeth St. John, the King&#8217;s first cousin. Leaving
his son Gerald as a hostage at the English Court, he returned
to Dublin as soon as possible, received the sword from Deane,
successfully invaded the O&#8217;Briens and Macnamaras, and was
fully reconciled to the Archbishop of Armagh. The Great Seal
was given to Fitzsimons, Archbishop of Dublin, a prelate
who had the courage to tell Henry that a certain courtly
orator flattered him too much. &#8216;Our father of Dublin,&#8217;
replied the King, &#8216;we minded to find the same fault ourselves.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Warbeck&#8217;s
third visit,
1497.</div>

<p>On July 20, 1497, Perkin Warbeck again made his appearance
at Cork. He got no help this time from Desmond,
who had been pardoned, and who had perhaps made up his mind
that the adventurer was an impostor. Sir James Ormonde was
accused of favouring him. The citizens of Waterford at once
gave Henry notice, and with four ships fitted out by themselves
gave chase to Perkin, who found no encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
in Ireland, and lost no time in going to join the Cornish
malcontents. Narrowly escaping capture at sea, he managed
to raise a force of 6,000 or 7,000 men, besieged Exeter and
Taunton unsuccessfully, and then ran away without striking
a blow, and took sanctuary at Beaulieu in Hampshire. The
inglorious close of his career is unconnected with Ireland, and
he seems on this last occasion to have had no Irish allies. The
citizens of Waterford received from the King a cap of maintenance
to be borne on certain occasions before the mayor, and
the title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Urbs intacta</i>, in which the city still glories. The
sum of 1,000 marks which he had promised for the capture of
Perkin was not, strictly speaking, earned by the Waterford
men; and their loyal and, doubtless, very costly exertions,
received no money recompense from the frugal King.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Considerations
as to
Simnel and
Warbeck.</div>

<p>The modern historian, whose fortune it has been to clear
up all doubts about Perkin Warbeck, takes Lord Bacon to
task for overrating the excellence of the pretender&#8217;s acting.
But Bernard Andreas, the principal if not the only contemporary
writer, certainly gives one to understand that he
played his part very plausibly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Carried to Ireland by a fair wind he suborned with his
very cunning temptations a great part of the barbarians of
that island. For he unfolded and retold from his ready
memory all the times of Edward IV., and without book
repeated the names of all his familiars and servants as he had
been taught them from a boy. He habitually added circumstances
of time, place, and person, with which he very easily
persuaded the levity of those men. And with the help of
such figments the matter grew so important, that men of
prudence and high nobility were induced to believe the same.
What followed? Certain prophecies concerning him were
scattered far and wide by false prophets, which completely
blinded the mental perceptions of the common people.&#8217;</p>

<p>It must be admitted that Lord Bacon did not speak with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>out
considerable authority. A contemporary French poem,
which was probably also written by Bernard Andreas, gives
a very unflattering account of Ireland as a cave of robbers,
&#8216;where is neither peace, love, nor concord, but only treasons
and the foulest deeds.&#8217; Such material help as the pretender
received was entirely among the Anglo-Irish. The native
annalists do not mention him, whereas Simnel is, at least by
one writer, spoken of as an undoubted prince of the blood
royal.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Piers
Butler kills
Sir James

<p>Sir James Ormonde, whose mother was an O&#8217;Brien, used
the help of his Irish connections to oppress Sir Piers Butler,
whom he imprisoned, but afterwards released at Desmond&#8217;s
request, &#8216;upon trust that he should have married the Earl&#8217;s
daughter.&#8217; One of Kildare&#8217;s first acts after his restoration
was to summon Sir James to Dublin, and to proclaim him
outlaw on his refusal. But this scarcely lessened his power
in the Butler country, and did not even prevent him from
assuming the title of Earl of Ormonde. Driven to great
straits, Sir Piers asserted that his rival had imprisoned him
&#8216;contrary to his oath and promise made upon the holy cross
and other great relics ... and that the same Sir James,
not pondering his said oath and promise, showed openly that
wheresoever he would find me he would kill me.&#8217; After this
Sir James, for the second time, refused to appear before the
King. The two Butlers met accidentally in the open field
between Dunmore and Kilkenny, and after a short struggle
Sir James was slain.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Consequent

<p>According to some accounts this encounter or murder,

delicate health. &#8216;Truly, Margaret,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;thou shalt
have store of wine within this four and twenty hours, or else
thou shalt feed alone on milk for me.&#8217; One writer says that
there were desperate odds against Sir Piers; and if this be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
true, and considering the then state of Ireland, the guilt of
murder can hardly attach to him. The death of Sir James
was decidedly beneficial to Ireland, for it made peace between
the Houses of Kildare and Ormonde.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of 1498.</div>

<p>In 1498 Kildare received a commission to hold a Parliament
which was not to last for more than six months. The
first Act of this Parliament was to confirm the reversal of the
Lord Deputy&#8217;s attainder, who by a singular anomaly thus
exercised viceregal authority, notwithstanding the corruption
of his own blood; the last to attaint Lord Barrymore
and John Waters for their dealings with Perkin Warbeck.
Waters was caught, found guilty by a Westminster jury, and
hanged at Tyburn, alongside of the pretender. Lord Barrymore
escaped arrest, but was murdered by his brother, the
Archdeacon of Cork. Kildare visited and garrisoned Cork,
forcing the chief inhabitants to take the oath of allegiance to
Henry, and to give bonds for future good behaviour. Of the
other Acts passed, the most important was one for the discouragement
of Irish habits and weapons. Henceforth
dwellers within the Pale were enjoined to wear only English
dress, and to wield only &#8216;English artillery,&#8217; such as swords,
bucklers, pavesses, bows, arrows, bills, crossbows, guns, or
such hand weapons&mdash;darts and spears being prohibited; and
they were to ride in saddles in the English fashion.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare&#8217;s
wars in
Ulster.
Cannon
are used.</div>

<p>It was Kildare&#8217;s fortune not only to give trouble himself,
but to be the progenitor of those who were to give trouble
in future. The rebellion of his grandson Thomas Fitzgerald
was to cause the eclipse of his house. The descendants of
his daughter Alice were to be the chief disturbers of the
Elizabethan monarchy in Ireland. She had married Con
More O&#8217;Neill, who was naturalised by Act of Parliament,
and this gave her father a fair excuse for interfering in the
affairs of Ulster. Con More had been treacherously killed
by his brother Henry in 1493, and the murderer fought for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
supremacy with his brother Donnell. Henry was at first
successful, and Donnell, whom Lady Alice appears to have
favoured, could only keep up a desultory opposition. In
1497 a peace or truce was made, but in the following year
Tirlough and Con, Lady Alice&#8217;s two young sons, killed
Henry in revenge for their father&#8217;s death, and invited Kildare
to come himself into Ulster. Besides his grandsons,
the Lord Deputy had the help of Donnell O&#8217;Neill, of
Maguire, of O&#8217;Donnell, and of most of the neighbouring
clans against Henry O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s sons and partisans. Cannon
were brought against Dungannon, which soon surrendered.
Omagh was afterwards taken, and Donnell was established
as chief of Tyrone. Firearms were perhaps first brought to
Ireland in 1483, when six muskets, considered a great rarity,
were sent from Germany as a present to Kildare, and were
borne by his guards more for show than for use. In 1487
an O&#8217;Donnell was killed by a cannon or musket shot in a
local broil, and in the following year Kildare brought ordnance
against Balrath Castle. In 1495, as we have seen,
heavy guns were successfully used for the defence of Waterford,
and the mention of firearms in the Act of 1498 shows
that their importance was quickly recognised. Cannon came
in time to be the peculiar weapons of the King, their great
expense putting them out of the reach of private combatants,
and no doubt it was gunpowder that caused the downfall
both of the feudal and of the tribal systems.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare&#8217;s
wars in
Connaught
and Ulster.</div>

<p>In 1499 the Lord Deputy, who acted pretty much as
if there were no King in England, made an excursion into
Connaught, and garrisoned certain castles. About the same
time Piers Butler was defeated in battle by the O&#8217;Briens,
but the causes of neither quarrel have been handed down to
us. It was the policy of the Anglo-Norman nobles in Ireland
to make themselves allies among the Irish, and in pursuance
of this idea the Earl gave up his son Henry to be fostered
by his late ally, Hugh Roe O&#8217;Donnell, who came to visit him
in the Pale. Kildare afterwards held a Parliament at Castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Dermot; but its acts had no political significance, unless
the punishment of certain nobles for not wearing Parliament-robes,
and for not using saddles, be considered an exception.</p>

<p>Donnell O&#8217;Neill and his nephews did not long remain at
peace, and O&#8217;Donnell, siding with the latter, expelled Donnell
from Dungannon. Kildare again invaded Tyrone, in conjunction
with O&#8217;Donnell, and took Kinard Castle, which he
handed over to his grandson Tirlough; but six weeks later
it was retaken by Donnell O&#8217;Neill. For more than two years
after this no event of any importance is recorded; there were
ceaseless wars among the Irish, but the Lord Deputy does not
seem to have interfered with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare in

<p>In 1503 Kildare visited England by the King&#8217;s orders, and
remained there three months. Having licence from Henry
to appoint a substitute, he selected his old antagonist the
Archbishop of Dublin to act as Lord Justice in his absence.
The Earl remained three months in England, and was
allowed to bring back his son Gerald, who had been a

<p>In 1504 a quarrel arose between Kildare and Ulick
MacWilliam Burke, Lord of Clanricarde, who had married
his daughter, Lady Eustacia. The only cause assigned by
any of the authorities is, that MacWilliam ill-treated his
wife. He had, however, seized the town of Galway, and
that might be provocation enough for a Lord Deputy. Two
great armies were collected&mdash;MacWilliam having the O&#8217;Briens
and Macnamaras, the Connaught O&#8217;Connors, and the MacBriens,
O&#8217;Kennedys, and O&#8217;Carrolls on his side. With the
Deputy were a portion at least of the O&#8217;Neills, O&#8217;Donnell,
MacDermot, Magennis, O&#8217;Connor Faly, O&#8217;Ferrall, MacMahon,
O&#8217;Reilly, O&#8217;Hanlon, and some of the Mayo Burkes, the
Mayor of Dublin, the Earl of Desmond, and the Lords
Gormanston, Slane, Delvin, Killeen, Dunsany, Trimleston, and
Howth. Notwithstanding this formidable array of names,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Kildare&#8217;s army was far inferior to MacWilliam&#8217;s in point of
numbers. Both bishops and lawyers appeared at the council
of war which preceded the battle: Art O&#8217;Neill objecting
to the former and O&#8217;Connor Faly to the other. The one
declared that the bishops&#8217; duty was &#8216;to pray, to preach, and
to make fair weather, and not to be privy to manslaughter;&#8217;
and the other expressed great contempt for pen and ink and
for &#8216;the weak and doubtful stomachs of learned men.&#8217; &#8216;I
never,&#8217; he said, &#8216;saw those that were learned ever give good
counsel in matters of war, for they were always doubting,
and staying, and persuading, more in frivolous and uncertain
words than Ector or Launcelot&#8217;s doings.&#8217; Lord Gormanston
was unwilling to risk so much without first knowing the
King&#8217;s pleasure; but Lord Howth, as represented by the
family chronicler, saw that good advice might come too late,
and that being in the field they must fight. He proposed
that they should conquer or die, having first placed their
sons in safety, so as to secure vengeance in case of defeat.
This plan was frustrated by young Gerald&#8217;s refusal to retire.
MacWilliam&#8217;s army made certain of victory, and spent the
night drinking, playing cards, and arranging about the
custody of prisoners. The battle took place at Knocktuagh
or Knocktoe, now generally written Knockdoe, a hill near
Clare Galway. Kildare is said to have reminded his followers
that the enemy, though very numerous, were ill-armed,
many with one spear only and a knife, and &#8216;without wisdom
or good order, marching to battle as drunken as swine to
a trough.&#8217; When the fighting began &#8216;Great Darcy&#8217;&mdash;the
man who had borne Lambert Simnel on his shoulders&mdash;appeared
as one of the chief champions on the Deputy&#8217;s side.
Kildare gained a complete victory. The &#8216;Book of Howth&#8217;
represents the gentry of the Pale as sustaining the brunt of
the battle, while the &#8216;Four Masters&#8217; tell the story as if both
armies consisted of aboriginal Irishmen only. According to
the former authority, Lord Gormanston made the following
speech to the Lord Deputy:&mdash;&#8216;We have done one good
work, and if we do the other we shall do well. We have for
the most number killed our enemies, and if we do the like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
with all the Irishmen that we have with us, it were a good
deed.&#8217;</p>

<p>Galway and Athenry were occupied without difficulty after
the battle, and the Lord Deputy&#8217;s Irish allies withdrew to
their own countries. The arduous task remained of persuading
Henry VII. that all had been done in his interest.
Kildare sent his old antagonist the Archbishop of Dublin to
Court, who performed his mission so well that the King
professed himself quite satisfied, and soon afterwards made
his Deputy a Knight of the Garter. Perhaps Henry was
not really deceived, but thought it good policy to make his
great subject&#8217;s victories his own. Sixty years afterwards,
when Sir Henry Sidney solicited a garter for another Earl of
Kildare, he urged his suit in these words:&mdash;&#8216;King Henry
VII. made his grandfather, and wist full what he did when
he did so; he enlarged the Pale, and enriched the same more
than 10,000<i>l.</i> worth.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of 1508.</div>

<p>Of the remaining years of Henry VII.&#8217;s reign but little
seems to be recorded, except that the chronic war among the
native tribes did not cease. Kildare held a Parliament in 1508,
in which a subsidy of 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> was granted out of every
ploughland, whether lay or clerical. About the same time
a party of the O&#8217;Neills took Carrickfergus Castle, and carried
off the mayor. In 1509 Kildare again invaded Tyrone in
the interests of his grandsons, and demolished Omagh.
When the King died he was in full possession of the government,
and without a rival in those parts of Ireland which
were in any real sense subject to the English Crown.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry endeavoured
to separate
the two
races.</div>

<p>It was the decided policy of Henry VII. to act in the
spirit of the Statute of Kilkenny, and to separate the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
and Irish districts. The well-known name of the Pale, or
the English Pale, seems to have come into general use about
the close of the fifteenth century. A great number of ordinances
remain to prove how necessary it was for the Englishry
to bear arms, and the practice of fortifying the home district
against the Irish became a subject of legal enactment at
least as early as 1429. An Act of the Parliament of 1475
declares that a dyke had been made and kept up from Tallaght
to Tassagard, at the sole cost of four baronies&mdash;Coolock,
Balrothery, Castleknock, and Newcastle&mdash;and provision was
made by statute for its future maintenance. This was an
inner line for the defence of Dublin only, but the Parliament
of Drogheda made a similar provision for the whole
Pale. It was enacted that every inhabitant of the marches
or inland borders of Dublin, Meath, Kildare, and Louth,
should, under a penalty of 40<i>s.</i>, make and maintain &#8216;a
double ditch of six feet above ground, at one side, which
meareth next unto Irishmen,&#8217; the landlord forgiving a year&#8217;s
rent in consideration of this work. The legal provision was
afterwards enforced by writs addressed to the sheriffs and
justices, and the name of Pale was perhaps first given to
the district so enclosed. The building of this Mahratta
ditch may be considered to mark the lowest point reached
by the English power in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">FROM THE ACCESSION OF HENRY VIII. TO THE YEAR 1534.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Accession
of Henry
VIII., 1509.
Kildare
remains in
power.</div>

<p>Henry VIII. was proclaimed without opposition, and amid
great rejoicings in all the principal towns, but his accession
made no immediate difference to Ireland. Kildare prepared
to go to the new King, but the Council, who felt their helplessness
without him, chose him Lord Justice, and constrained
him to stay. His patent as Lord Deputy was not
long withheld, and other official men were for the time continued
in authority. The Earl was summoned to Court, but
excused himself on the grounds that he could not be spared,
and, as the Council sustained him, the King made no objection.
Attended by the chief men of the Pale he invaded
Munster, and, being joined by O&#8217;Donnell, penetrated into
Desmond and took Castlemaine, as well as the so-called
palace of the MacCarthies near Killarney. He met with
scarcely any resistance, and seems to have had no higher
object than plunder. Near Limerick, Kildare was joined by
Desmond&#8217;s eldest son with the main force of the southern
Geraldines and the MacCarthies of Carbery and Muskerry.
The Lord Deputy passed into Clare by a wooden bridge
which the O&#8217;Briens had erected near Castleconnell, and
which he broke down behind him. Here he was met by
Tirlough O&#8217;Brien, the chief&#8217;s son, accompanied by the Macnamaras
and the Clanricarde Burkes. The hostile armies
bivouacked at such close quarters that they could hear each
other talking at night. At daybreak Kildare retired along
the right bank of the Shannon, and reached Limerick in
safety with the bulk of his plunder. The Munster Geraldines,
with their Irish auxiliaries, marched in the van as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
not being over trustworthy. In the rear, the post of honour
in a retreat, were the O&#8217;Donnells and the men of the Pale.
Such was the settlement of differences between Geraldines
and De Burgos, which the chief governor had alleged as the
main obstacle to his attendance upon his sovereign. It was
indeed his interest to be always at war, for he had obtained
a grant in tail of all such possessions as he could recover
from any rebel in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> This method of paying a viceroy
with letters of marque cost the Crown nothing, but the
greatest ingenuity could hardly have devised a plan more
fatal to an unfortunate dependency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Activity of
Kildare,
1512, 1513.</div>

<p>During the next year Kildare kept pretty quiet, but was
soon again in the field. Crossing the Shannon at Athlone
he plundered and burned all before him to Roscommon,
where he placed a garrison, and then prolonged his destroying
course to Boyle. Here he met O&#8217;Donnell, who came to
him over the Curlew Mountains. This chief had lately made
a pilgrimage to Rome, and spent four months in London
going and as many more on his return. He was well received
by Henry VIII., but we have unfortunately no details.
In this same year Kildare invaded Ulster, took the castle of
Belfast, and spoiled the land far and wide. In the following
summer he marched against Ely O&#8217;Carroll, but while watering
his horse in a stream near his own castle of Kilkea he
was shot by one of the O&#8217;Mores, and died soon afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
His son Gerald was at once chosen Lord Justice by the
Council, and the King continued him in authority<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> on the
same terms, and with a similar grant of all lands he could
recover from the rebels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Earldom
of
Ormonde in
abeyance.</div>

<p>The rival house of Ormonde was at this time depressed
by the loss of its head without male issue. Early in 1515
died Thomas, the seventh Earl, the only Irish peer whom
Henry VII. or Henry VIII. called to the English House of
Lords, who was reputed the richest subject of the Crown, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
is said to have left the enormous sum of 40,000<i>l.</i> in money,
besides jewels. He had two daughters, who inherited his
personal property and seventy-two manors in England. Ann,
the eldest, was married to Sir James St. Leger, Margaret,
the younger, to Sir William Boleyn, by whom she had Sir
Thomas, who became grandfather to Queen Elizabeth. Sir
Piers Butler, a descendant of the third Earl, was heir male to
the title and to the settled Irish estates, which at once
became matters of dispute between him and the ladies St.
Leger and Boleyn. With the full approval of the Irish
Butlers, Sir Piers at once assumed the title of Earl. He had
married Lady Margaret Fitzgerald, sister of the new Lord
Deputy Kildare, a woman of lofty character and stature, to
whom Irish tradition, with an endearing irony, has given the
name of Magheen or Little Margaret. In compliance with
letters from the King, Sir Piers was ordered to appear before
his brother-in-law and the Irish Council; but he sent his
wife instead, to urge that he was busy fighting. The lady,
who must have had a delicate task between her husband and
her brother, procured an adjournment, and it was stipulated
that no rents should be paid in the meantime. The late
Earl&#8217;s daughters appeared by counsel in due course, and it is
evident that Henry leaned strongly to their side. They
offered evidence of title, but Sir Piers staid away and left all
to his wife and his lawyers. The latter contented themselves
with practically demurring to the jurisdiction, and
prayed to have the case tried at common law; which would
probably have secured a decision for their client. The Lord
Deputy referred all back to the King, and the tenants continued
to pay no rent. Kildare wished to command Sir
Piers on his allegiance to appear before the King in England
on a certain day; but he was overruled by the Council, who
believed that this would drive Butler into rebellion; and as
its acknowledged chief, he could command all the forces of
his family. He chanced, moreover, to be at peace with the
reigning Desmond, and he had strengthened himself by
alliances among the Irish. These considerations prevailed
with the King or with Wolsey, and the case remained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
abeyance; but it had gone far enough to cause an irreparable
breach between Kildare and the rival chief.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare
visits
England in
1515. His
restless
policy.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the Lord Deputy trod in his father&#8217;s footsteps.
He made successful raids on the O&#8217;Mores and O&#8217;Reillys, and
for slaying many of the latter had a grant of the customs of
Strangford and other places in Down. A visit to England
in 1515 resulted in permission to hold a Parliament in the
following year, but it produced no legislation of importance.
He took and dismantled Leap Castle, the stronghold of the
O&#8217;Carrolls, which his father had failed to gain, and he surprised
Clonmel by a sudden march, though we know not
what offence that town had given him. When he was busy
in the north, where he destroyed O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s castle at Dungannon
and stormed Dundrum, which was defended by
Magennis, the O&#8217;Carrolls rose again and invaded Meath.
Again Kildare visited Ely and destroyed another castle.
The history of two viceroyalties may indeed be told in a
single sentence. Every year or two the Earl of Kildare
harried some Irish country, and then reported such and such
execution done upon the King&#8217;s enemies. There was no
attempt to keep the peace among the natives, the highest
policy being the setting of one chief against another. The
O&#8217;Neills and O&#8217;Donnells continued their everlasting feuds,
and nearly every tribe was constantly at war. Occasionally
they made foreign alliances, as in the case of O&#8217;Donnell, who
was a travelled man. A French knight coming on a visit to
St. Patrick&#8217;s Purgatory was hospitably received by the chief,
and offered to recover Sligo from the O&#8217;Connors. The offer
was accepted, and in due course an armed vessel appeared in
Killybegs Harbour. Sligo was battered from the sea, the
O&#8217;Donnells co-operating by land, and the castle surrendered.

<div class="sidenote">Miserable
state of the
country.</div>

<p>The chiefs of English race were almost as restless as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Celts whom they affected to despise, and the state of the
Pale was as bad as bad could be. John Kite, a Londoner, who
had been promoted to the throne of Armagh by Wolsey&#8217;s
influence, informed his patron that he tried to comfort the
people by promising that the King would soon come to
reform the land. He insisted very reasonably that the King
was as much bound to maintain order and justice in Ireland
as in England herself. The sea was no safer than the land,
and the ship which brought the Archbishop from Chester
had been attacked by two pirates; but the men of Drogheda&mdash;no
thanks to the Government&mdash;had captured the rovers.
Even the Countess Dowager of Kildare, who was the
daughter of an English knight, complained that her stepson
allowed O&#8217;Neill to levy tribute on her lands, and that her
property and that of her dependents was laid waste. Portions
that had escaped the Irish were seized by the Earl&#8217;s own
steward. Kildare had many other accusers, and was at
length summoned over to give an account. He was allowed
to appoint a Deputy, and nominated his cousin, Maurice
Fitzgerald of Lackagh, who was soon afterwards killed by the
O&#8217;Mores. But the cry of the land had been heard at last,
and Henry resolved to send over a governor whom he could
trust. The lot fell upon Thomas, Earl of Surrey, the son
and companion in arms of the victor of Flodden, whose
influence at Court probably made his absence desirable to
Wolsey.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

Anarchy.</div>

<p>The first thirty pages of the printed State Papers are
taken up with a report to the King on the state of Ireland,
founded on an earlier document, but corrected and brought
down nearly to the date of Surrey&#8217;s appointment. It discloses
a state of things calculated to try the ablest governor.
In Ulster and Connaught, in the counties of Waterford,
Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick, Kerry, Carlow, Westmeath, and
Wicklow, and in parts of Kildare and Wexford, there was
neither magistrate nor sheriff. Districts wholly or partially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
peopled by men of English race were under black-rent to
the native chiefs. This odious tax was paid by the Savages
of Lecale in Down to the O&#8217;Neills of Clandeboye. The
great chief of Tyrone levied his dues in Louth. Meath and
Kildare were tributary to O&#8217;Connor Faly, Wexford to the
Kavanaghs, Kilkenny and Tipperary to O&#8217;Carroll, Limerick
to the O&#8217;Briens, and Cork to the MacCarthies. MacMurrough
Kavanagh, who in the eyes of the natives represented the
ancient royalty of Leinster, actually received eighty marks
out of an almost empty exchequer. The sum of the several
black-rents amounted to 740<i>l.</i>, and this was at a time when
a soldier received fourpence a day. Dublin was in constant
danger, and one of Henry&#8217;s first acts was to grant 20<i>l.</i>, a year
to the citizens for repairing their walls, which had crumbled
through decrease of population, pestilence, and Irish violence.
A line drawn from Dundalk to Kells, from Kells to Kilcullen
Bridge, and thence by Ballymore Eustace, and Tallaght
to Dalkey, enclosed the whole actual Pale, upon which fell
all the expenses of an establishment intended to meet the
wants of all Ireland. The King&#8217;s taxes had to be paid, coyne
and livery were extorted, horses and carriages were requisitioned
for the public service; and with all this the Government
could give no protection, no judge went circuit, and
black-rent was perforce paid in addition. &#8216;The King&#8217;s army
in England,&#8217; said Henry&#8217;s informant, &#8216;is the commons, the
King&#8217;s army in Ireland is such as oppress the commons.&#8217;
The nobility and gentry copied the Government, and it was
more than suspected that they dreaded any reform which
would force them to obey the law; &#8216;for there is no land in
all this world that has more liberty in vices than Ireland,
and less liberty in virtue.&#8217; The Church showed no better
example than the lay magnates; &#8216;for there is no archbishop
nor bishop, abbot nor prior, parson nor vicar, nor any other
person of the Church, high or low, great or small, that useth
to preach the Word of God, saving the poor friars&#8217; beggars.&#8217;
Some Irish chiefs kept better order than the Government;
&#8216;but not to the intent that his subjects should escape harmless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
but to the intent to devour them by himself, like as a greedy
hound delivereth the sheep from the wolf.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remedies
suggested.</div>

<p>Ireland has never lacked physicians, though she has often
been nothing bettered by them. The most obvious means
to strengthen the English power was to make the men of
the Pale keep arms and practice their use; and this had been
the constant cry of governors and legislators for many generations.
Henry had directed Kildare to get an Act passed
obliging every merchant trading from England to Ireland
to bring a pound&#8217;s worth of bows and arrows for every 20<i>l.</i>
of wares, so as to prevent the King&#8217;s subjects from applying
themselves to Irish archery. Patrick Finglas, Baron of the
Exchequer, was less sanguine than the writer of the State
Paper which has been so largely quoted. That reformer
ventured to prophesy that if his advice were taken the war
of Ireland would cease for ever, the King would recover
Constantinople and die Emperor of Rome, and Ireland once
reduced to order would be &#8216;none other than a very paradise,
delicious of all pleasance.&#8217; But Finglas admitted that reform
must necessarily be gradual, and advised the King to confine
himself at first to the reclamation of Leinster. He recommended
that the chief abbeys and castles should be entrusted
to Englishmen, from Bray Head round the coast to Dunbrody
on the Suir, and inland from Baltinglass and Carlow
along the Barrow to Ross. The Wicklow Highlanders
would be thus bridled and unable to attack Kildare. Athy
and other places were to be held against the O&#8217;Connors and
O&#8217;Mores. The Butlers seem to have been thought able to
take care of themselves. It would not do to give up the
castles to men who had great possessions in England, and
who would never encourage English farmers to become their
tenants. At first settlers would have to be protected, but
in time would take care of themselves. There would be no
difficulty about tilling the soil, &#8216;for there be no better
labourers than the poor commons of Ireland, nor sooner will
be brought to good frame, if they be kept under a law.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Irish
exactions.</div>

<p>Besides the payment of black-rent, the commons of Ire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>land
were oppressed by innumerable exactions, of which the
principal may be described once for all. Bonaght was a tax
imposed by a chief for the support of his mercenary horsemen,
gallowglasses, and kerne. The name was often transferred
from the tax to those who were maintained by it, and
Bonaght, or Bony, became the generic name for an Irish
mercenary or for one from the Scotch isles. Sorohen was
an obligation on certain lands to support the chief with his
train for twenty-four hours once a quarter, or, according to
another account, as often as once a fortnight. Coshery was
the chief&#8217;s right to sponge upon his vassals with as many
followers as he pleased. Cuddies, or night-suppers, were
due by certain lands upon which the chief might quarter
himself and his train for four days four times a year. Shragh
and mart were yearly exactions in money and kine respectively,
apparently imposed at the will of the chief. Worse
than any of these was coyne and livery&mdash;that is, the taking
of horse-meat and man-meat from everyone at the will of the
chief; in other words, the right of the strongest to take
what he liked. Coyne and livery were not the invention of
an Irish chief, but of one of those Anglo-Normans who knew
how to better native instruction. Maurice Fitz-Thomas, Earl
of Desmond, is said to have begun it under Edward II. as
the only available means of coping with Edward Bruce.
Originally a contrivance for carrying on war at the enemy&#8217;s
expense, it came to be used by all great men at all seasons.
James, the ninth Earl of Desmond, has the credit of first
imposing it on loyal subjects, but the Crown was primarily
to blame for neglecting to keep order. Lords Deputies
showed no better example than private oppressors.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Surrey
finds all in
confusion.</div>

<p>Surrey landed with his family at Dublin on May 23,
bringing 100 men of the royal guard as a peculiar mark of
favour. He found the country in rather more than its usual
confusion. He sent Archbishop Rokeby to Waterford, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
succeeded in preventing Sir Piers Butler from fighting with
Desmond, and he himself marched into Leix with his
English soldiers, 120 Irish mercenaries, and 300 kerne.
The English of the Pale, who, from love or fear of Kildare,
usually mustered so strong on these occasions, contributed
only forty-eight horse and 120 foot. Surrey made war in the
usual Irish fashion, and burned Connell O&#8217;More&#8217;s country.
He was joined by Sir Piers Butler, who brought a strong
contingent, including Mulrony O&#8217;Carroll, whom he induced
to take the oath of allegiance. O&#8217;Carroll had latterly done
great harm in the Pale, and he was considered the best
leader among the Irish. He refused to take the oath until
Surrey rashly promised that Kildare should never be Deputy
again. On being pressed about a letter which the Earl was
said to have written to him, he at first said that he would not
inform even were he to receive the viceregal pavilion full of
gold; but in spite of all this bravado he allowed his brothers
to be examined, and they both swore that they had stood by
and heard the letter read. Surrey never saw the document
itself, nor has it been preserved. According to the report
which we have, Kildare had directed O&#8217;Carroll to keep the
peace till the arrival of an English Deputy, and then to
make war on all Englishmen except the writer&#8217;s friends.
The object was to make all government but his own impossible.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">O&#8217;Donnell
is friendly.</div>

<p>On his return to Dublin, Surrey found O&#8217;Donnell waiting
for him. That chief had probably pleasant recollections of
his visit to the English Court, and was not unwilling to
strengthen himself against his rival O&#8217;Neill. He told Surrey
that his powerful neighbour had urged him to make war on
the Pale, and had declared his own intention of doing so, in
compliance with Kildare&#8217;s directions. O&#8217;Donnell promised
to invade Tyrone if the Lord-Lieutenant would do likewise
from the opposite quarter, and remarked emphatically that
if the King ever set Kildare in authority again he might as
well convey Ireland to him and his heirs for ever.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">O&#8217;Neill
temporises.</div>

<p>Early in August, Surrey, accompanied by Sir Piers Butler
and his forces, entered Farney and punished MacMahon
for the assistance given to O&#8217;Neill in his attacks on the
Pale. O&#8217;Neill made some sort of verbal submission, and
the Lord-Lieutenant returned to Dublin, where he detected
a conspiracy among his soldiers, some of whom found life
intolerable in Ireland. Their plan was to seize a small vessel
in the river, and by her means a larger one on the high seas,
and so to become rovers. The Irish lawyers held that the
Viceroy could not hang them; for they had committed no
overt act, and his patent did not authorise him to proceed
by martial law. It is clear that the Crown was held capable
of dispensing with the common law, at least in the case of
soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmonds
and MacCarthies.</div>

<p>In September an important private war was waged in
Munster. James, Earl of Desmond, according to the usual
practice of his family, made a perfectly unprovoked attack
upon Cormac Oge MacCarthy, the chief of Muskerry. Having
secured the assistance of Sir Thomas Fitzgerald, the Earl&#8217;s
uncle and his own sister&#8217;s husband, and of his kinsman
MacCarthy Reagh, Cormac Oge defeated Desmond in a
pitched battle near Mourne Abbey, to the south of Mallow.
The messenger who brought the news to Dublin reported
that the Earl had lost 1,500 foot and 500 horse. The Lord-Lieutenant
was not sorry, for he had straitly charged Desmond
to leave the MacCarthies alone. The fate of the Desmonds
has excited much not very well directed sympathy:
it would better become Irishmen to remember that they were
the worst oppressors of their Celtic neighbours.</p>

<p>When Surrey visited Munster soon after, Desmond met
him at Clonmel, and was as loyal in words as Sir Piers
Butler had been in deeds. At Waterford he met MacCarthy
Reagh and Cormac Oge, who were adherents of Sir Piers, and
who had come on his invitation. They spoke fairly, bound
themselves to keep the peace and professed themselves loyal,
so that they might be protected. Surrey wished to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Cormac Oge a Privy Councillor and a Baron of Parliament,
and he calls him a &#8216;sad wise man.&#8217; Cormac produced a
charter under the Great Seal, a copy of which was sent to
England with an assurance that it comprised no lands to
which the King was entitled.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry
speaks
boldly to
the Irish.</div>

<p>It was probably to Cormac Oge that Henry wrote a
remarkable letter, which shows his intentions at this time.
The Irishman, whether Cormac Oge or another, was willing
to surrender his lands and take an estate tail from the Crown
at a fair rent. It was the interest of native chieftains to do
this, because it secured them as against the Government,
while it enabled them to transmit to their children a property
which was not theirs at all, but held in trust for the clan at
the election of the clansmen. The one fear of Henry&#8217;s correspondent
was that he should after all be abandoned to
Kildare&#8217;s vengeance, and he counselled the employment of
a large army. To this the King answered that he had no
intention whatever of giving up his plans for the reduction
of Ireland, that he would not remove Surrey, and that he
would not reinstate Kildare in the government. When
peaceful means failed it would be time to put forth his
strength. In language which reminds us of the royal speech
in the ballad of &#8216;Chevy Chase,&#8217; he remarked that this Irish
enterprise was a trifle compared with those which he had in
hand against France and Scotland. This was politic language
in dealing with a half-civilised MacCarthy, but Henry
spoke very differently to his own servants. There was talk
of an alliance between Argyll and O&#8217;Neill, and of a Scotch
descent upon Ireland. The Continent was disturbed, and
the burden of three armies would be intolerable. And yet
he would try to do justice to Ireland. He was an absolute
monarch and above legal trammels, but might even condescend
to consider himself bound, if by so doing he could
induce Irish chiefs to live by law. If that of England proved
too strong for weak stomachs, they might even retain some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
of their native customs. The Earldom of Ulster was legally
his own, but he would not willingly take it by force. If
clemency failed, in the last resort he would try the strength
of his hand, for realms without justice were but tyrannies,
communities of beasts rather than reasoning men. Brave
words! but woefully belied in action.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Surrey is
not sanguine.</div>

<p>Surrey was not to be deceived, and steadily refused to
prophesy smooth things. He believed that Ireland could
only be reduced by conquest, and that the easiest method
was to master one district at a time, gradually pushing forward
the frontier until the whole country was obedient. A
permanent army of 500 men might perhaps effect this, while
at least 6,000 would be required for a rapid conquest.
Edward I. had taken ten years to subdue Wales, and that
great king had given almost constant personal attention to
the work. Yet Wales was unprotected by the sea, and was
not a fifth part the size of Ireland. All artillery and munitions
of war would have to be brought from England, and
fortresses must be built to bridle each tract of country successively
occupied. Nor could a military occupation endure
unless accompanied by a large plan of colonisation. Thus
only could the natives be brought to labour and settled
order. We can see, though Henry VIII. could not, how
justly Surrey estimated the magnitude of England&#8217;s task in
Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Activity of
Surrey.</div>

<p>In July 1521 the Irish bordering on the Pale took their
usual advantage of the season. O&#8217;Connor, O&#8217;More, and
O&#8217;Carroll, the latter all unmindful of his last year&#8217;s oath and
of more recent promises, collected a great host and prepared
to attack the Pale. Surrey, who had lately prorogued his
Parliament after a ten days&#8217; session, was in Dublin, and by
his promptitude averted the danger. O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s castle, near
Edenderry, was soon in his hands, being unable to resist the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
fire of three pieces of heavy ordnance for a single day. It
became an axiom in Irish warfare that the Government could
always make its way with artillery. Surrey proposed to
hold O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s stronghold permanently, and to use it
against the Irishry as Berwick was used against the Scots.
He destroyed all the corn far and wide, the people with
their cattle flying before him, while Sir Piers Butler played
the like part in Ely O&#8217;Carroll. The vigour shown by the
Lord-Lieutenant had the effect which vigour generally has
in Ireland, and the confederacy gave him little further trouble.
Meanwhile, the North was in a blaze. O&#8217;Donnell professed
loyalty, but was not trusted by Surrey, who, however,
thought it wise to humour him. O&#8217;Neill was willing to be
on good terms with the Government, and was on his way to
Dundalk accompanied by Magennis and a large force, when
the O&#8217;Donnells attacked him in the rear. Fifteen hundred
cows were driven off and seventeen of the Magennis&#8217; villages
burned, so that the allies were forced to retrace their steps.
The chief of Tyrconnell feared that if his great neighbour
were once at peace with the Pale he would be too
strong for him in the everlasting private war of Northern
Ulster.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Uncertainty
of
English
policy.</div>

<p>It is not the least of Ireland&#8217;s misfortunes that her rulers
have ever been subject to hot and cold fits. In the autumn
of 1521 Henry suddenly changed his mind. Disgusted at
the apparently almost fruitless expense, he not only relieved
Surrey at his own earnest request, but also abandoned his
policy. War broke out between Charles and Francis, and
the reformation of Ireland, which had but lately seemed so
necessary a work for a Christian king, was lightly postponed
to a more convenient season. Surrey is the first of a long
series of able men whose efforts, generally very ill seconded
at home, in the end brought Ireland under the English
sceptre. His means were inconsiderable. In the expedition
against O&#8217;More, which he undertook very soon after landing,
his whole force seems not to have exceeded 700. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
then asked the King for eighty horsemen from the North of
England, and for leave to discharge as many of the guardsmen
as he might think fit. Many of these were well-to-do
householders, and liked Ireland so little that they were content
to leave it on receiving twopence, or even a penny, a
day. One hundred horsemen were accordingly sent, under
the command of Sir John Bulmer, who was Surrey&#8217;s personal
friend, and fifty more were added from Wales. The
captain received half-a-crown and the lieutenant eighteenpence
a day. On their arrival 117 guardsmen were discharged
upon a penny a day. Fourpence appears to have been a
soldier&#8217;s ordinary pay in Ireland, and Surrey maintained
that this was not enough. Neither Welshmen nor Northumbrians
proved to his taste, most of them being mounted
archers and not spearmen. He thought better men might
be had in the country, and Henry was willing to give him
much latitude, though he cautioned him against employing
too many Irishmen, lest the sword should hurt his hand.
The King gave his Viceroy the power of life and death, reserving
noble personages, and the right of making knights.
A golden collar was sent for O&#8217;Neill, and it was supposed that
such cheap defences would avail against a chief who could
easily raise 1,600 men. Of two evils Surrey chose the less;
he discharged most of Bulmer&#8217;s men, whom he pronounced
ill-looking, worthless rascals, and took Englishmen of the
Pale in their places. The difficulty of buying forage was
thus obviated, as native horsemen could find it for themselves.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of 1521.</div>

<p>A Parliament sat in Dublin for ten days in June 1521,
and after many prorogations was not finally dissolved till
March 1522, when Surrey had left Ireland. There appears
to be no record of the peers who attended, or of the places
represented, and so little mention is afterwards made of this
Parliament that the interest attaching to it was probably
slight. Acts were passed making arson treason, forbidding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the exportation of wool as the cause of a &#8216;dearth of cloth
and idleness of many folks,&#8217; and providing against the failure
of justice through lack of jurors.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Want of
money.</div>

<p>The Irish Government had no command of money, the
judicious employment of which might enable them to dispense
with troops. Surrey&#8217;s expedition to Munster was near
failing for want of means to pay his men. Before the end
of August the exchequer was habitually empty; no taxes
were due till Michaelmas, nor leviable till Christmas; and
nothing was to be had except for ready money.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The King
sent 4,000<i>l.</i>, but would not face the necessities of the case.
It seemed to him monstrous to have to spend 1,600<i>l.</i> or
1,700<i>l.</i> a year merely for the defence of the Pale. His remittances
were mere palliatives, and Surrey was in difficulties
during his whole term of office.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Surrey recalled

<p>Surrey had to cope with disease as well as poverty. It
was scarcely possible to find healthy quarters for soldiers,
and the people fled everywhere into the fields, leaving unburied
bodies behind them. No place in Ireland was safe,
and the Lord-Lieutenant, who lost three of his servants, was
anxious about his wife and children. Sir John Bulmer never
had a day of health in Ireland, and was glad to get home
safe without having seen any service. In the second year of
his government, Surrey himself was affected with the fever
and diarrh&oelig;a which have often been fatal to the English in
Ireland, but his prayers were heard at last, and he was
recalled in time to save his life. He was much regretted by
the inhabitants of the Pale, who recognised his good nature,
integrity, and ability. Those who best knew the subject
believed that he really saw how the country might be reduced
to order, and it was hoped that he would return with
sufficient means. Meanwhile, the Irish Council entreated
Wolsey to be guided by his advice.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Beloved by the King&#8217;s subjects and feared by rebels,
Surrey left one of the fairest names among those who have
ruled Ireland. He paid in full for everything, so that the
market followed him wherever he went, and he declared that
he would rather eat grass than feast with the curses of the
poor. His retinue had orders to behave in Ireland as they
would at home. So generous was he that the common
people thought him the King&#8217;s son. Nor was he less just,
for he gave full notice of his intended departure, and discharged
all debts due by him or his. It was thought that
he never offended within the compass of the seven deadly
sins during his stay in Ireland; tradition, with a fine contempt
for facts, adds that &#8216;in his time was corn, cattle, fish,
health, and fair weather, that the like was not seen many
years before.&#8217; We know from his own letters that corn was
dear and sickness prevalent, and we may be very sure that
the weather was not always fair.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Piers

Deputy,
1522.</div>

<p>Henry had too much respect for Surrey&#8217;s opinion to hand
back Ireland at once to Kildare; but he had resolved to
reduce expenses, and was therefore obliged to place the
government in the hands of someone who had the strength
to make authority respected. No one satisfied this condition
except Sir Piers Butler, and Surrey was allowed to appoint
him Deputy, retaining the office of Lord-Lieutenant himself.
There were objections to Sir Piers, as to every Irish governor.
The Butlers would not take the field except under him or
his eldest son, and he was generally laid up with gout all
the winter. Lord James, as the heir was called, was active
enough, but young and inexperienced. The choice, however,
lay between Ormonde and Kildare, and Sir Piers was so
cautiously handled, that he abstained from driving a hard
bargain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">O&#8217;Neills
and

<p>The experiment was not very successful; for the Geraldines
were all-powerful in the Pale, and the new Lord
Deputy, when in Dublin, was separated from his own country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
by his rival&#8217;s dominions. He took the oath on March 26,
1522, but the O&#8217;Mores, who had heard that Kildare was
on his way to restore the good old times, soon began
to threaten the Pale. In the North a war broke out on
such an unusually large scale as to make it probable that
O&#8217;Neill had promised Kildare to give the new Deputy as
much trouble as possible. Indeed, when Kildare did actually
return, he at once went to O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s aid. The chief of
Tyrone may have required little persuasion to attack his hereditary
foes, but the number of his allies was very uncommon.
MacWilliam of Clanricarde, Tirlough O&#8217;Brien, Bishop of
Killaloe, with many of his clansmen, O&#8217;Connor Don and
O&#8217;Connor Roe, MacWilliam of Mayo, and MacDermot of
Moylurg, all agreed to assemble on the southern border of
Donegal. O&#8217;Neill brought to the trysting place Magennis,
O&#8217;Rourke, and MacMahon, and many Scottish mercenaries
in the hereditary service of his family. &#8216;Great numbers,&#8217;
we are told, &#8216;of the English of Meath, and the gallowglasses
of the province of Leinster, of the Clan-Donnell and Clan-Sheehy,
also came thither, from their attachment to the
daughter of the Earl of Kildare, who was O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s mother.&#8217;
To oppose this vast host, O&#8217;Donnell had only the clans immediately
subject to him, O&#8217;Boyle, O&#8217;Gallagher, O&#8217;Dogherty,
and the three septs of MacSwiney, hereditary gallowglasses
of Tyrconnell. He mustered his forces near Trim, on the
Tyrone side of the Finn, and there awaited the onset. But
O&#8217;Neill adopted tactics very usual in Irish warfare, passed
by the northern shore of Lough Erne, reached Ballyshannon
without fighting, and slaughtered the garrison of
MacSwineys there. O&#8217;Donnell retaliated by sending his son
Manus to ravage the nearest districts of Tyrone, and himself
hurried in pursuit of O&#8217;Neill across the pass now called
Barnesmore Gap. Again declining battle, O&#8217;Neill turned back,
spoiled the country between Donegal and Letterkenny, and
encamped on the hill which overlooks Strabane. O&#8217;Donnell
returned very quickly over Barnesmore, and, having been
rejoined by his son, faced the enemy near Lifford. There he
held a council of war, and his followers in desperation re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>solved
on an immediate fight. Leaving their horses behind,
the O&#8217;Donnells crept up unperceived, drove in the outposts,
and entered the camp pell-mell. In the darkness and confusion
faces could not be distinguished, and many O&#8217;Neills
fell by the hands of their brethren. Nine hundred dead
bodies were counted in the morning, including many of the
Leinster men who had come for the love of Kildare. Celtic
war always presents the same features, and the victorious
O&#8217;Donnells quickly disbanded with the horses and armour,
the strong liquors and the rich drinking vessels of the vanquished.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">O&#8217;Donnell
is stronger
than
O&#8217;Neill.</div>

<p>When he had again collected his men, O&#8217;Donnell recrossed
Barnesmore, passed between Lough Melvin and the sea, and
encamped at the foot of Benbulben, the bold hill which tourists
admire from Sligo. The Connaught men were besieging
that place when they heard of O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s victory, and of his
near approach. They offered to negotiate, and, having thus
gained time, they broke up from Sligo and retreated rapidly
to the Curlew mountains, where they separated. The panegyrists
of the O&#8217;Donnells sing pæans over two victories obtained
without the help of English or Scotch allies, and
remarkable in Irish warfare, the one for its slaughter, the
other for its bloodlessness. Next year O&#8217;Donnell carried the
war into Tyrone, which he ravaged as far as Dungannon.
At Knockinlossy he destroyed a beautiful herb-garden, which
must have been a rare thing in those days, and from Tullahogue,
where he established a temporary camp, he spoiled
the land far and wide. All the plunder was carried off safely,
and the invaders then returned for more; but peace was
made instead, and they turned their arms against O&#8217;Rourke.
Fermanagh was wasted as Tyrone had been, and we cannot
be surprised that chiefs who thus preyed on each other should
fail to make head against the English Government.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Piers
Butler is
thwarted
by the
Geraldines.</div>

<p>During his short tenure of office, Sir Piers Butler undertook
but one warlike expedition. He chastised the O&#8217;Briens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and killed one of their leaders at the ford of Camus on the
Suir. But Kildare had returned to Ireland, and was active
in the field, acting at first in apparent unison with the Lord
Deputy. Supported by O&#8217;Neill, to whose arbitration differences
were submitted, he reduced to quiet the clans on the
border of the Pale. With both Butlers and Geraldines, the
main object was to enlarge and secure their hereditary
territories; but the former sought support in England, the
latter among the wild tribes of Ulster. Lady Kildare, a
daughter of Grey, Marquis of Dorset, whom the Earl had
married during his late visit to England, complained bitterly
to Wolsey that Sir Piers oppressed her husband, spoiled his
tenants and friends, and made alliances with the wild Irish.
She attributed this to Kildare&#8217;s refusal to act partially in the
dispute with the Boleyn family. Sir Piers Butler had married
Kildare&#8217;s sister, and he might not unreasonably count upon
his brother-in-law&#8217;s assistance; but throughout the contests
of this century personal considerations were of little power
compared with those of clanship and family pride. Kildare&#8217;s
brother James killed Robert Talbot of Belgard, on his way
to Kilkenny, and it seems that the Geraldines regarded all
gentlemen of the Pale who opposed them as no better than
spies. But Sir Piers was naturally incensed at the outrage
on his friend and visitor.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare in
Ulster.</div>

<p>The general lawlessness is well shown by an expedition
which Kildare undertook against O&#8217;Neill of Clandeboye,
partly, as he owned, in revenge of the damage done to his
property there, and partly, as he told the King, to punish
attacks upon English merchants. At Carrickfergus he found
a Breton ship which had just landed a cargo of Gascon wine.
England and France were at peace, but the foreigners were
fain to avoid capture by putting to sea without having been
paid for their goods. The taste for claret was early developed
in Ireland, and this relief from payment may have had a
charm like the exemption from legal duties in more modern
times. A Scotch vessel laden with provisions, which lay out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
in Belfast Lough, was attacked by the Geraldines in boats
and forced ashore. Hugh O&#8217;Neill, who had 1,500 Scots with
him, rescued the crew, and in revenge Kildare destroyed
Belfast and two other castles, and burned the country for
twenty-four miles round. The Mayor of Carrickfergus and
three of the chief townsmen were sent prisoners to England
for trading with the French and Scots. If we are to believe
Kildare&#8217;s account, the Lord Deputy took the opportunity of
handing over his castles to the O&#8217;Connors, of making a league
with O&#8217;Carroll, and of carrying off 500 stud mares and colts
from the county of Kildare.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare is
restored.</div>

<p>It became evident at last that Sir Piers Butler was not
strong enough to govern without Kildare&#8217;s help, and Henry
reverted to his father&#8217;s policy of entrusting all Ireland to the
man whom all Ireland could not govern. One more effort
was made to reconcile the rivals by sending over royal commissioners,
who prevailed upon them to make an agreement
under seal as the basis of mutual concession. Kildare&#8217;s stud
mares had been taken by a namesake of his own, but Sir
Piers covenanted to give them up if they came within his
power. The subsidy payable by Tipperary to Kildare when
he was Deputy was forgiven, as was half the subsidy paid by
the county of Kildare to Butler during his tenure of office.
In general, everyone was to behave well, to keep the peace,
and not to make friends with Irish rebels.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrangements
for
local government.</div>

<p>Butler and Kildare, and the principal gentlemen living on
the marches of the Pale, were bound at this time to adopt a
certain order in their countries, the two greater chiefs under
penalties of 1,000 marks each, and the others in sums varying
from 200 marks to 40<i>l.</i> They made themselves liable in
general for their own acts and for those of their sons and
brethren, covenanting not to use the Brehon law nor those
Irish exactions which usually accompanied it, and to repress
crime as far as their power reached. Kildare, on his appoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>ment
as Deputy, covenanted with the King not to make war
or peace with Irishmen at the public charge without consent
of the Council. This was intended to prevent another
Knocktoe. Coyne and livery for the public service were to
be reduced to fixed rules. Householders were to be allowed
to compound by paying twopence a meal for a footman, and
threehalfpence for a horseman or groom; twelve sheaves of
oats for a trooper, and eight for a draught horse was to be the
allowance, and not more than one boy was to accompany each
horse. If the Earl travelled on private business, or on his
way to attend Parliament, he was not to take coyne and livery
save from his own tenants; and in no case except for the
actual use of soldiers, nor for more than one night in one
place, nor for successive nights within a distance of nine
miles. It had been the custom to charge the farmers for
&#8216;black men,&#8217; that is, for soldiers who only existed in name
and as a means of extortion. Treaties with Irishmen were
not to be made to prejudice the Crown, nor were pardons to
be given without the consent of the Council. The King&#8217;s
castles were to be kept in repair, and the Earl was to do his
best to make the people of the Pale speak, dress, and shave
like Englishmen. The salaries of the judges were to be paid;
and Kildare promised if possible to have sheriffs, escheators,
and coroners appointed in Meath, Dublin, Louth, Wexford,
Kilkenny, Tipperary, and Waterford, and to provide for the
holding of Quarter Sessions in due course.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> It is noteworthy
that the counties of Kildare and Cork are not mentioned, and
that Tipperary is; the probability being that the two former
were purposely excluded as being under Geraldine influence.
As to the Butler Palatinate of Tipperary, it is possible that
only the ecclesiastical portion or cross was intended, but it is
more likely that Kildare purposely placed his rival&#8217;s district in
a worse position than his own or those of Desmond. On the
other hand, he promised not to go to war with the Butlers, or
with their allies the Darcys and Nugents, without the consent
of the Council. The new Lord Deputy promised not to purchase
during his tenure of office any lands of which the title<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
was in dispute. James Fitzgerald was carried to England to
answer for the death of Talbot, and led through the streets of
London with a halter round his neck; but was pardoned in
defiance of Wolsey&#8217;s opinion at the intercession of Denton,
Dean of Lichfield, who had been one of the commissioners
lately sent to Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Butlers
and
Geraldines
still
quarrel.</div>

<p>In spite of all precautions, the perennial quarrel of Butlers
and Geraldines was not stopped by the appointment of Kildare.
Sir Piers sent his son James to London to watch the
family interests there, in which task he was to be guided by
Robert Cowley. Kildare even asserted that Sir Piers had
given a signet to his trusty adherent, with the aid of which
he might attest any written statement he chose to make.
James Butler was either really too much occupied with the
pleasure of the Court, or was crafty enough to appear so,
while waiting for an opportunity. &#8216;Surely,&#8217; his father wrote,
&#8216;unless I see your time better employed in attendance of my
great business, than ye have done hither, I will be well
advised or I do send you any more, to your costs.&#8217; A chief
part of the business was the prisage of wines, especially at
Waterford, which had always formed an important part of
the Butler revenue. Kildare, as Lord Deputy, had insisted
that an account should be given into the Exchequer, and Sir
Piers argued that this was done merely to annoy him, and
not at all out of regard to the King&#8217;s revenue. He declared
that the indentures which the new Deputy had executed
were &#8216;in no point observed,&#8217; and, in particular, that coyne and
livery were ruthlessly exacted, two villages in Kilkenny having
to maintain no less than 420 gallowglasses. The Butler
tenants were so impoverished that they could pay no rent
and, moreover, the Deputy had not paid the half-subsidy of
800<i>l.</i> as he had bound himself to do. The King peremptorily
ordered payment, but the claim was still disputed, and it does
not appear that the money was ever handed over. Meanwhile,
Lord Leonard Grey, the Deputy&#8217;s brother-in-law, pressed
many grave complaints upon the royal attention. Sir Piers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
was accused of levying coyne and livery for craftsmen as well
as soldiers, and for his hunting establishment. There were
separate packs for hare, stag, and martin, and no less than
sixty greyhounds; the whole charge on Kilkenny and Tipperary
amounting to 2,000 marks.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Recriminations.
Great
disorders.</div>

<p>Sir Piers was further accused of illegally occupying Callan
and other royal manors in Kilkenny and Tipperary, but these
lands were soon afterwards specially granted to him and his
wife, and to their heirs male. Kildare charged his rival with
helping O&#8217;Carroll and lending him cannon to defend Leap
Castle against him. The fact was hardly disputed, but it had
occurred as far back as 1516, and it was alleged in answer
that the attack on O&#8217;Carroll was wanton and unprovoked.
There were also accusations of intriguing with the O&#8217;Mores,
of spoiling a village in Kildare and slaughtering the people
even at the altar, of using the Castle of Arklow to rob the
lieges by land and sea, of levying illegal taxes, and, in short,
of behaving as Anglo-Irish noblemen generally did. A far
graver charge against Sir Piers was the not having punished
certain of his servants who were present at the barbarous
murder of Maurice Doran, Bishop of Leighlin. The murderer
was Maurice Kavanagh, his own Archdeacon, whom the
Bishop had reproved for his crimes. It was said, moreover,
that the churches in Tipperary and Kilkenny were ruinous,
and that Sir Piers was in all things under the influence of his
wife, the Lord Deputy&#8217;s sister. It is satisfactory to know
that the Bishop&#8217;s tonsured assassin did not escape, for Kildare
had him hanged and disembowelled at the scene of the
murder: he was a near relation of Sir Piers Butler, which
may account for the Lord Deputy&#8217;s anxiety to do justice in
this particular case.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare

<p>Kildare never ceased to harass such Irish chiefs as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
chose to consider his enemies. In the autumn of 1524 he
led an army to help his kinsman O&#8217;Neill against O&#8217;Donnell,
and encamped near Strabane. Manus O&#8217;Donnell, who had
just returned from Scotland, wished to attack at once with
his strong force of Macdonnells; but he was overruled by his
father, who feared the Deputy&#8217;s artillery. Flights of arrows
were directed against the intrenchments all night, and in the
morning Kildare thought it prudent to make peace and to
depart without fighting. His old enemy Hugh O&#8217;Neill
attempted to intercept him, but was killed in the skirmish
which ensued. After this Kildare seems to have kept quiet
for some months, and to have endeavoured to make peace
among the Ulster clans. O&#8217;Neill and O&#8217;Donnell, or O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s
son Manus, visited Dublin; but all efforts to reconcile
them were ineffectual, &#8216;so that they returned to their homes
in strife, and the war continued as before.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Butler goes
to England,
1526.
Kildare
sent for the
next year.</div>

<p>In September 1526 Sir Piers Butler went to England
to press his various suits, and to complain of Kildare&#8217;s conduct.
At Bristol he was in great danger of his life, the
citizens having quarrelled with his retinue, who were probably
for the most part Irish in speech and habits. According
to Sir Piers the townsmen were the aggressors, and no
provocation was given to the 600 men who surrounded his
lodgings and threatened to set the house on fire. In spite of
the interposition of the mayor and of some of the King&#8217;s
officers, Sir Piers was obliged to surrender certain of his men
and to find securities for the rest. A grant of considerable
possessions in Ireland rewarded him for the troubles and
dangers of the journey to Court. He accused Kildare of
conspiring with Irish enemies to help Desmond in the
foreign intrigues which he was undoubtedly carrying on,
and of neglecting to arrest him when ordered to do so by
special letters from the King. It was said that he entered
Munster for the ostensible purpose of effecting this arrest,
but sent private word to Desmond to avoid him, and to plead
his privilege not to attend Parliament or enter walled towns.
It was scarcely fair to expect that the head of one branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
of the Geraldines should willingly imprison the head of
the other; but Kildare was also accused of employing Irish
enemies to oppress the Butlers, was summoned to London,
and was at once committed to the Tower. He was soon
brought before the Council, and Wolsey is said to have
assailed him in a violent speech, calling him King of Ireland,
a king who was able to bring back his own from the furthest
edge of Ulster, but who would do nothing against a rebellious
lord who had defied the Crown of England. After a time
Kildare interrupted the Cardinal, saying that he was no
orator, and that if he did not answer each charge in detail as
it was uttered, his memory would fail him and his case would
thus be prejudiced. This was considered reasonable, and the
Earl hastened to ridicule the notion that Desmond&#8217;s liberty
depended on him. &#8216;Cannot,&#8217; he asked, &#8216;the Earl of Desmond
shift, but I must be of counsel? Cannot he hide him
except I wink?&#8217; Then he turned round upon Wolsey, whom
he averred to be quite as much king in England as he was in
Ireland. Indeed, he would willingly change places for one
month, and would engage to pick up more crumbs in that
time than could be bought with all the revenues of his Irish
earldom. &#8216;I slumber,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;in a hard cabin, when
you sleep in a soft bed of down; I serve under the King his
cope of heaven, when you are served under a canopy; I
drink water out of my skull, when you drink wine out of
golden cups; my courser is trained to the field, when your
genet is taught to amble; when you are begraced and belorded,
and crouched and kneeled unto, then find I small
grace with our Irish borderers, except I cut them off by the
knees.&#8217; Wolsey broke up the Council in high dudgeon, and
sent the Earl back to the Tower until further evidence
should arrive from Ireland. Before leaving Dublin, Kildare
had taken the precaution of seeing each Councillor separately
and binding him by oath to write in his favour.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wolsey

<p>Wolsey is said to have taken it upon himself to send a
death-warrant to the Governor of the Tower, which arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
while that officer was playing shovel-board with his prisoner.
On reading it the Lieutenant sighed, and Kildare remarked,
&#8216;By St. Bride, there is some mad game in that scroll, but
fall how it will this throw is for a huddle.&#8217; On learning
the contents of the paper he begged his gaoler to go straight
to the King and ask his real pleasure. Unwilling to offend
Wolsey, but still more unwilling to obey him, the Lieutenant
repaired to Whitehall and was at once admitted, though it
was ten o&#8217;clock at night. The King immediately respited
the execution, and is said to have used strong language, calling
Wolsey a saucy, over-officious priest, and threatening
him with unpleasant consequences.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">But the
Cardinal
has perhaps
been misrepresented.</div>

<p>Such is the received story. Yet Wolsey, who is represented
as thirsting for Kildare&#8217;s blood, was not even disposed
to remove him from the viceroyalty. This forbearance arose
from no love for the troublesome Earl, but it was thought
that if he were detained in England and treated with some
show of favour, his Irish adherents would be afraid to move.
In case the King should nevertheless resolve to remove
Kildare, then Wolsey advised that Sir Piers should again be
made Deputy, the real government being in the hands of his
son. Henry, however, thought that James Butler was too
young for so great a charge, and that the noblemen of
Ireland would disdain to be led by one who was junior to
them all.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Earldom

<p>While Kildare&#8217;s fortunes were thus clouded, his rival was
at Court looking after his own interests. The Earldom of
Ormonde, to which he was the true heir male, had been conferred,
together with that of Wiltshire, on Sir Thomas
Boleyn, grandson, through his mother, of the late Earl. Sir
Piers, who was too prudent to oppose the father of Anne and
Mary Boleyn, and who perhaps thought one earldom nearly as
good as another, was content to accept the title of Ossory.
Five years before, Henry had thought to reconcile the rival

<div class="sidenote">Sir Piers

Earl of

<p>The new creation was made at Windsor with great pomp.
Arriving late in the evening from London, Sir Piers, who
was in delicate health, lay at his own lodgings in the town,
as being warmer and more comfortable than the rooms of the
Lord Chamberlain, with whom he breakfasted next morning.
We are particularly told that good fires were lit after mass.
The Marquis of Exeter and the Earl of Oxford led the new
peer into the presence chamber, the Earl of Rutland bearing
the sword. The grandees dined together at the King&#8217;s
expense after the investiture, and then, having changed his
dress, the Earl was again conducted into the royal presence
by the Marquis of Exeter. Having taken leave of Henry
and of the Queen and Princess, and having duly feed the
waiters, Ossory returned to London, where he paid a parting
visit to Wolsey, and then returned into his own country.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Vice-Deputy

O&#8217;Connors,

<p>Leaving Kildare in the Tower, we must now go back to
Ireland, where Richard Nugent, seventh Baron of Delvin,
had been acting as Vice-Deputy, Sir James Fitzgerald, whom
Kildare had left in charge, having been superseded by the
Irish Council. When Archbishop Inge and Chief Justice
Bermingham heard of Kildare&#8217;s imprisonment, they wrote
to Wolsey regretting the Earl&#8217;s absence, and expressing
their doubts as to whether he was guilty of any such practices
as were charged against him. They considered Delvin
incompetent, for he had no great fortune of his own to eke
out the scanty revenue of Ireland. The people were more
heavily taxed than ever, and they were not defended; for
the armed bands which were always at Kildare&#8217;s beck and
call would serve no one else. As the Pale was desolated by
the absence of one Earl, so were Tipperary and Kilkenny by
the absence of another; and the worst was to be feared unless
they both speedily returned. These gloomy forebodings
were soon fulfilled; for Delvin, against the advice of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Council, withheld the black-rent which O&#8217;Connor, Kildare&#8217;s
son-in-law, had been used to receive from Meath. The
aggrieved chief surprised the Vice-Deputy on the march,
killed most of his men, and took him prisoner. Lord Butler,
who was present, had prudently provided himself with a safe-conduct;
he lodged that night with the victorious O&#8217;Connor,
and was allowed to have an interview with his distinguished
prisoner. The chief and his brothers were present, and
the two noblemen were not allowed to speak English nor to
confer in private. Speaking in Irish, O&#8217;Connor insisted on
having his black-rent again, or being paid a ransom for the
Vice-Deputy, and on receiving a distinct promise that the men
of the Pale should not avenge his overthrow. But Butler&#8217;s
diplomacy was not yet exhausted. By the advice of a Mr.
White, who was among O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s guests, he sought a
private interview with Cahir, the chief&#8217;s brother, who of
course had a party of his own among the clansmen. Cahir
readily agreed to escort Lord Butler out of his brother&#8217;s
country, and was afterwards persuaded to visit Lord Ossory
at Kilkenny. He professed loyalty and was ready to prove
it by his actions, if only he could be sure that Kildare would
not sooner or later return and have his revenge&mdash;that was his
only fear.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>While his son was thus by policy undermining the Irish
enemies of his house, Ossory was busy looking about for Irish
allies. Hard pressed by the Desmonds and O&#8217;Briens, he
wished to avoid a rupture with the O&#8217;Connors, and tried the
efficacy of smooth speeches. As the price of an alliance
against this possible foe O&#8217;Carroll demanded 40<i>l.</i>, besides
anything that the King or Deputy might give. O&#8217;More
claimed the help of the Butlers against Kildare, and a money
reward also. MacGilpatrick stipulated that Ossory should
release him from debts amounting to 400 marks. The Earl
agreed to these terms; but his immediate object was not
attained, for Delvin remained a prisoner until early in the
following year. In the meanwhile Sir Thomas Fitzgerald,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare is

<p>The late Lord-Lieutenant, now Duke of Norfolk, attributed
all the woes of Ireland to the quarrel between Butlers
and Geraldines, and he was on the whole in favour of maintaining
the latter faction in power. Ossory and his son
were loyal enough, but they could scarcely hold their own
against the Desmonds and O&#8217;Briens, and could do nothing in
the Pale, where they had no natural authority and where
public opinion was against them. They would be entirely
dependent on their own followers, who would eat more than
their services were worth. On the other hand, Robert
Cowley, Ossory&#8217;s faithful agent, was always at hand to prevent
Henry and Wolsey from yielding too completely to
Norfolk&#8217;s advice. It is said that on one occasion he complained
of Kildare to the Council, and that he shed tears
in the course of his speech &#8216;for pity,&#8217; as he said, &#8216;upon his
father&#8217;s son.&#8217; &#8216;He is,&#8217; retorted the Earl, &#8216;like the plover
taken in setting his snares, and waiting for his desired purpose,
his eyes being against the wind and the water dropping
out. So many plovers as he taketh he knocketh their brains
out with his thumb, notwithstanding his watery tears of contemplation.
Even like doth Mr. Cowley with me; his tears
cometh down; he layeth shrewd matters or articles to my

<div class="sidenote">The Duke
of Richmond

1529. His
Deputy,
Sir William
Skeffington.</div>

<p>If this story be true we must assign it to the autumn of
1528, when Cowley was certainly in London. O&#8217;Connor had
just invaded the Pale, and evidence afterwards came to light
which connected Kildare with his son-in-law&#8217;s proceedings.
Early in August, Kildare&#8217;s daughter Alice, the wife of Lord
Slane, came to Ireland and went straight to O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s
house. Sir Gerald MacShane Fitzgerald afterwards swore
before the Irish Council that Melour Faye had revealed to
him a secret agreement between himself and Kildare, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
that Lady Slane&#8217;s arrival was the preconcerted signal that
her father was detained in England. Ossory was at war
with Desmond when O&#8217;Connor made his attack, but abandoned
his expedition and hurried off to defend the Pale.
He took occasion to remind Wolsey of the hereditary policy
of the house of Kildare. By stirring up rebellion in Ireland
when he was detained at Court the late Earl had made himself
chief governor for life; his son had followed suit, and
the Pale had practically transferred its allegiance from the
King of England to the Earl of Kildare. Henry thought it
prudent to give the Earl his liberty, but resolved to have a
Viceroy who should hold Ireland for the Crown only. He
made his son, the Duke of Richmond, Lord-Lieutenant,
thereby giving the Emperor great offence, and assigned him
as Deputy Sir William Skeffington, a Leicestershire man,
who had been long in the public service. Meanwhile the
sovereign had frowned. In the month following that in
which Skeffington was appointed, Wolsey saw Henry at
Grafton for the last time, and three weeks later he was
indicted in the King&#8217;s Bench. Kildare remained in London,
for he was one of those who signed the famous letter to
Clement VII., in which the English notables reproached the
Pope for his partiality, and laid upon him the responsibility
of a disputed succession, with all its terrors and troubles.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Skeffington&#8217;s
instructions.</div>

<p>Skeffington had long served as Master of the Ordnance,
whence the Irish, who may have been offended at the
appointment of a commoner, gave him the name of &#8216;the
gunner.&#8217; He was accompanied by Edward Staples, a Lincolnshire
man, whom the King had appointed Bishop of
Meath, and brought with him 200 horse and a sum of money.
He was instructed in the first place to reconcile, if possible,
the conflicting interests of the Earls of Kildare, Ossory, and
Desmond. He was not to make any serious attack on the
wild Irish without the consent of the majority of the Council,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
especially when it would involve charging the country with
the support of an army. The established custom of taking
provisions for the ordinary movements of troops was, however,
allowed. Skeffington was to hold a Parliament, but was to
get all the money he could by way of subsidy before it met,
and to pay the gross levy into the Vice-Treasurer&#8217;s hands.
Kildare&#8217;s loyal promises were to be taken as sincere, and the
Deputy was enjoined to help him in his enterprises as if they
were undertaken in the King&#8217;s name. The Earl might retain
half the proceeds, provided the remainder were handed
over to the Vice-Treasurer.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

Submission

O&#8217;Donnell.</div>

<p>Kildare returned to Ireland some months after Skeffington&#8217;s
arrival, and his first exploit was to chastise the O&#8217;Tooles,
with the help of 200 archers supplied by the city of Dublin.
Next year Ulster was invaded. A treaty had already been
concluded at Drogheda, by which O&#8217;Donnell promised the
King allegiance, and bound himself to assist Skeffington
against all his Majesty&#8217;s enemies. He covenanted for
O&#8217;Reilly, Maguire, and MacQuillin, as well as for himself,
and Skeffington bound himself to give them such help and
protection as was due to the King&#8217;s subjects. In pursuance
of this agreement Skeffington, accompanied by Kildare and
Ossory, ravaged Tyrone on both sides of the Blackwater,
from Clogher to Caledon, and penetrated to Monaghan,
which was undefended. There O&#8217;Donnell and some malcontent
O&#8217;Neills met them, but they did not venture to meet
the tyrant of the North in the field, a measure of the weakness
of government at that time.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Skeffington
is overshadowed
by Kildare.</div>

<p>It clearly appeared that the Lord Deputy was in a false
position as regards Kildare. When the Butlers were out on
a foray, the Geraldines attacked their camp, killed the officer
on guard, and carried off horses, arms, and provisions. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
was even said that the Earl of Kildare displayed his banner
openly, and led his men to the attack. With great difficulty
and at Skeffington&#8217;s earnest request, Ossory prevented his
followers from retaliating, but he poured complaints into
Cromwell&#8217;s attentive ears. Kildare allowed his adherents to
seize the titular Baron of Burntchurch in Kilkenny, while
passing through Castledermot, on his way to attend Parliament.
The Baron was a Fitzgerald, but on friendly terms
with Ossory, who would have rescued him in spite of Kildare
but for the Lord Deputy&#8217;s express prohibition; as it was, the
poor man lost his horse, money, and apparel without redress.
&#8216;This,&#8217; said Ossory, &#8216;is a good encouragement to malefactors
to commit spoils, having the advantage thereof without punishment
or restitution.&#8217; It was not the first nor the last time in
Ireland that the friends of law and order have been less safe
than its enemies, and that the Government has hampered those
whom it could not protect. Indeed, the Kilkenny borough
members fared no better than their neighbours, for they were
seized at the gate of Athy by Murtagh MacOwney, who
wished that he had the King in the end of a handlock, and
the Deputy in the other end, as surely as he had the worthy
burgesses. In fact, Skeffington had scarcely any power.
Kildare detained the hostages of the natives, in spite of direct
orders to send them to Dublin, and thus let it be clearly seen
that the King&#8217;s representative was a mere instrument in his
hands.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare
goes to
England,
1532, and
regains
favour.</div>

<p>It was commonly said in Ireland that all the parchment
and wax in England would not bring the Earl of Kildare
thither again; but this saying turned out not to be true. So
well had the Earl managed his affairs, that he ventured across
the Channel early in 1532, and, after a six months&#8217; residence
at Court, returned with the legal as well as the real power of
a Chief Governor. Sir John Rawson, Prior of Kilmainham,
and Chief Justice Bermingham, supported Kildare&#8217;s counter-charges
against Ossory, and accused Skeffington of partiality
in his favour. There was an attempt to show that Ossory&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
hostility arose from the fear that Kildare would support Wiltshire&#8217;s
claims upon the Ormonde estates. But Ossory maintained
that he had long since compromised all claims against
his property, that Kildare&#8217;s advocacy of Wiltshire&#8217;s pretensions
was collusive and fraudulent, and that the King would
be the real loser of the possession, if such castles as Arklow
and Tullow were given to the too powerful Geraldine under
colour of another man&#8217;s sham title. Anne Boleyn&#8217;s star was
now at its zenith; her father was fond of money, and perhaps
saw a chance of extorting it from opposite quarters. It is
clear that any claim of his was likely at this time to be
favourably regarded, and it may be in this way that the lately
waning influence of Kildare was restored.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare

<p>Having secured the much-coveted patent, Kildare hastened
to Dublin and relieved Skeffington, who, having arrears of
business to transact, was allowed to dance attendance among
other suitors in his successor&#8217;s ante-chamber. On the very
day of his arrival, the new Lord Deputy took the Great Seal
from his enemy Archbishop Alen, and gave it to the Primate
Cromer. As a sop to the opposite faction, Lord Butler was
made Lord Treasurer by the King; but the Deputy was
supreme in the Council, and those who were not his friends
thought only of saving themselves from his anger. Thus relieved
from all restraint, and perhaps thinking himself indispensable,
as indeed he well might, the Earl turned upon his
hereditary enemy. While his brother Sir John Fitzgerald
was helping O&#8217;Neill to ravage Louth, the lawful guardian of
the Pale devastated Kilkenny; his men were allowed to
plunder the peaceable folk resorting to Castledermot Fair, and
to murder a due proportion. He used the sword which the
King had committed to him &#8216;utterly to extinguish the fame
and honour of any other noble man within that land ...
shadowed with that authority, so that, whatever he did, it
should not be repugned at.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The

<p>There was at this time a fierce dispute as to who should

time &#8216;destroyed most in regard to foreigners and improved
most in regard to Gaedhill.&#8217; A brother would in the usual
course have succeeded to these glories; but there was always
a strong tendency to substitute the hereditary for the elective
principle, and a claim was advanced on behalf of Mulrony&#8217;s
son Fergananim, to whom Kildare, choosing his time, had just
given his daughter. Ossory of course espoused the cause of
the brothers, but was defeated with the loss of several small
pieces of cannon. On the same day the old chief died, and,
as he favoured his son&#8217;s pretensions, this was numbered
among his victories. Having been a man of blood, and having
lavished some of his plunder upon the clergy, he was rewarded
after death with hyperbolical praises. &#8216;He was,&#8217; the
&#8216;Four Masters&#8217; inform us, &#8216;a protecting hero to all; the guiding
firm helm of his tribe; a triumphant traverser of tribes;
a jocund and majestic Munster champion; a precious stone;
a carbuncle gem; the anvil of the solidity, and the golden
pillar of the Elyans.&#8217; Fergananim was at first acknowledged as
chief, but his uncle soon occupied Birr and other castles, and
ravaged the country from thence. The Lord Deputy came
in person before Birr, and received a bullet wound in the
side. As he groaned with the pain, a kerne is reported to
have encouraged him by saying that he himself had three
bullets in him, and felt none the worse. &#8216;I wish,&#8217; replied the
Earl, &#8216;you had this one along with the others.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> He was less
fortunate than his follower, for the bullet, which came out of
itself some months later, lamed him for life, and affected his
speech. Birr Castle was, however, taken.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of 1533.
Miserable
state of the
country.</div>

<p>Kildare held a Parliament in Dublin in 1533, but we know
nearly as little about it as about that held by Surrey. The
most important law passed appears to have been one for the
punishment of those who stole corn under colour of taking
wages for harvest work in kind. This meeting of Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
gave rise to a renewal of the old dispute about precedency
between Armagh and Dublin. Alen could no longer rely
upon the patronage of Wolsey, and it is certain that Kildare&#8217;s
influence would be exerted against him. But the Deputy had
been making so many enemies, that the increased hostility of
Alen would not count for much. A heavy reckoning had
been scored up; and John Dethyke, or Derrick, a prebendary
of St. Patrick, gave voice to the prevailing discontent. With
bitter irony he assured Cromwell that the people were excellently
disposed and full of abstinence. Their accustomed
ceremony was to abstain from flesh on Wednesday, but their
devotion had so much increased that they now abstained likewise
on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. &#8216;I trust
to Jesu,&#8217; he continued. &#8216;Ye shall hear that there shall be
many saints among them; but they play the fox&#8217;s part, shy
of hens when he could not reach them.&#8217; All the butchers in
Dublin had not as much meat between them as would make
a mess of broth, and those who owned no cattle were driven
to dry bread. Marauders entered the suburbs of Dublin, and
one butcher had lost 220 beasts. No one could safely ride
a mile out of town, and it was useless to complain; for the
Deputy was visited with that distressing form of deafness
which affects those who do not wish to hear. The poor
butchers had accordingly shut up their shops, and taken to
making leather breeches, as if it were perpetual Lent. And
not only did the Viceroy do nothing, but he took the opportunity
of removing the King&#8217;s artillery from Dublin to his
own castles. Meanwhile, the O&#8217;Byrnes actually entered
Dublin Castle, and carried off prisoners and cattle, &#8216;insomuch
as nightly since great watch is in the city of Dublin, fearing
that the same should be pilfered, prostrate, and destroyed,
whereof they never dreaded so much.&#8217; Even Sir James Fitzgerald
complained that his brother oppressed him cruelly for
having done good service under Skeffington, and Norfolk&#8217;s
tenants in Carlow were in no better plight.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Charges

against
Kildare.</div>

<p>The Council did not directly attack Kildare; but they
sent over Sir John Alen, the Master of the Rolls, to enlighten
Henry upon the true state of affairs. They directed Alen to
report that English laws and customs were unknown except
within twenty miles of Dublin, and that unless something
were done they would soon be driven even from that contracted
area. Various errors of policy, such as the practice
of entrusting viceregal power to Irish lords and of giving
away Crown lands, had so strengthened the Irishry and weakened
the Pale, that the King would soon not have revenue
enough to maintain a Deputy. Two archbishops, two bishops,
four of the great regular ecclesiastics, two temporal peers, and
three judges signed the document embodying these severe
strictures, and they reminded Henry that unless he looked
the better to it, Ireland might be used against him by any
enterprising foreign enemy. Even more outspoken was a
native of Ireland, closely associated with the Master of the
Rolls, who declared that loyal subjects had been ill requited,
and that people had come to look upon the viceroyalty as part
of Kildare&#8217;s inheritance. Everyone who opposed him suffered
for it, and all his offences were passed over. &#8216;Always after
the malice of the Geraldines was resisted and the land staid,
the King withdrew his aid from thence, putting the malefactors
in his authority; whereas, if he had continued the
same there, and suppressed the others, undoubtedly a marvellous
profit and commodity should have issued thereby.... What
subjects under any prince in the world
would love, obey, or defend the right of that prince, which
(notwithstanding their true hearts and service toward him)
would afterwards put them under the governance of such as
should daily practise to prosecute and destroy them for the
same?&#8217; The question has often been asked in Ireland since
then.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The

<p>The confusion between the Earl of Kildare, in his own
character, and in that of Lord Deputy, was not at all conducive
to good government. Private opposition to the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
was easily represented as treason to the King in his representative&#8217;s
person, and was indeed likely enough to grow into
it. It was believed that the recent murder of Ossory&#8217;s son
Thomas by Dermot Fitzpatrick was not altogether the work
of Irishry. Kildare and his sons and brothers provoked
attacks on every side. The moral effect of O&#8217;Byrne&#8217;s raid
had of course been disastrous, and no one felt himself safe.
The principal remedies suggested were the appointment of
a Deputy for a long term, Norfolk being preferred, and after
him Skeffington, the abolition of Irish customs, and the
education of young noblemen and chiefs&#8217; sons at the English
Court. Local presidencies were also recommended, but the
first thing was to get rid of Kildare. The Geraldines indeed
did not conceal that their interests were not those of the
Crown. &#8216;Thou fool,&#8217; said Sir Gerald MacShane to the Earl&#8217;s
brother Thomas, who had some legal scruples, &#8216;thou shalt be
the more esteemed in Ireland to take part against the King;
for what hadst thou been if thy father had not done so?
What was he set by until he crowned a King here; took
Garth, the King&#8217;s captain, prisoner; hanged his son; resisted
Poynings and all Deputies; killed them of Dublin upon Oxmantown
Green; would suffer no man to rule here for the
King, but himself? Then the King regarded him, made him
Deputy and married thy mother to him; or else thou shouldst
never have had foot of land, where now thou mayst dispend
400 marks by year, or above.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>As the result of Alen&#8217;s efforts, Kildare was summoned to
Court. The Earl doubtless felt that his chances would be
small if once the Tower gates closed upon him, and he sent
his wife over to get the order revoked, on the old ground
that he could not be spared. Lady Kildare&#8217;s diplomacy
failed, and her husband was summoned a second time; but
was allowed to appoint a Vice-Deputy. This may, or may
not, have been a bait to induce him to go quietly, for nothing
less than an army could have taken him by force. Skeffington
had been working hard against his enemy, and was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
constant communication with Cromwell, watching the port of
Chester, so as to be in London as soon or sooner than the
Earl. He reported that Lady Kildare&#8217;s servants delayed the
King&#8217;s letters purposely, and that he was most anxious for
the moment when he should at last be able to prove his
charges against the Lord-Deputy.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His eldest
son remains
as Deputy.</div>

<p>Kildare had now no choice but between obedience and
open rebellion. Before embarking at Drogheda he delivered
the sword to his eldest son in the presence of several members
of Council. Thomas Lord Offaly, better known as Lord
Thomas and Silken Thomas, was about twenty years old, and
his father advised him to be guided in all things by his uncle,
Sir James Fitzgerald; his cousin, Sir Thomas Eustace; his
great-aunt, Lady Janet Eustace, and her husband and son,
Walter and James Delahide. It is impossible to pronounce
on the genuineness of the speech which the chronicler puts
into Kildare&#8217;s mouth, but the advice contained in it would
have been well suited to the occasion. He told his son that
his youth should be guided by age; his ignorance by experience.
He was, he said, putting a naked sword into a
young man&#8217;s hand, and urged him to defer to the Council,
&#8216;for albeit in authority you rule them, yet in counsel they
must rule you.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE GERALDINE REBELLION&mdash;SKEFFINGTON&#8217;S ADMINISTRATION,
1534-1535.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare is
sent to the
Tower.</div>

<p>Among the letters which Alen brought with him from England
was one of thanks for past services to Connor Maguire, chief
of Fermanagh. Maguire belonged to the party in Ulster
which opposed O&#8217;Neill, and consequently Kildare; and he
seems to have been in some degree under Alen&#8217;s influence.
He now wrote to the King, adding to the already overwhelming
case against Kildare, and praying for the appointment
of Skeffington. This despatch probably reached London
about the same time as the Earl, who was examined by the
Council and at once sent to the Tower. The heaviest charge
against him was that of fortifying his own castles with the
King&#8217;s artillery; and it was in fact this which enabled his
son to make head for a time against the Crown. He could
only answer that he had intended to defend the Pale against
the Irish: perhaps the hesitation caused by his wound was
taken for the confession of guilt. He was no longer the man
who had bearded Wolsey in his pride; and, unfortunately,
his old power of repartee had descended to his son, who
annoyed with his taunts those whom he should most have
conciliated. The young Vice-Deputy made no secret of his
dislike to the King&#8217;s policy, sought alliances with O&#8217;Brien
and Desmond, and gave the enemies of his House plausible
grounds for stigmatising him as a traitor from the very
first.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His death
prematurely
reported.</div>

<p>Early in the summer of 1534 a report reached Ireland
that Kildare was to be beheaded, and his son and brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
arrested. A poor retainer of his house living near Kilcullen
is said to have brought to Lord Offaly from London a little
silver-gilt heart and a pair of black dice, with a verbal
message from his father bidding him not to trust the Irish
Council, but to keep out of the way lest he should lose life
and liberty. About the same time a private letter from
Thomas Cannon, who had been in Skeffington&#8217;s service, confirmed
the sinister rumours already afloat. In days when
there were no newspapers such letters were handed about
freely, and this one fell into the hands of a priest who read
English with difficulty, and who put it aside until he had
time to spell out its meaning. A retainer of Offaly&#8217;s, who
chanced to stay the night in the priest&#8217;s house, used the letter
as a shoe-horn, and forgot to withdraw it. Undressing in the
evening he found the paper, read it out of curiosity, and
found to his dismay that it announced Kildare&#8217;s death. He
at once took the fatal missive to James Delahide, who carried
it to the Vice-Deputy. Delahide was one of those whose
advice Kildare had directed his son to take: he now counselled
him to rebel and to avenge his father&#8217;s death.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His son
rebels.</div>

<p>Though his death was at hand Kildare still lived, and
there is no reason to suspect foul play: he was old and suffering
from wounds, and confinement or anxiety may well have
hastened his end. But his impetuous son assumed the worst,
and at once prepared for war. His Irish connections O&#8217;Neill
and O&#8217;Connor approved his resolution; but the Earl of Desmond,
Sir Thomas Eustace of Baltinglass, Fitzmaurice of
Kerry, Fleming, Lord of Slane, and most of the Anglo-Irish
well-wishers of his House, counselled prudence. Lord Chancellor
Cromer, a grave and learned divine, gave similar advice.
But Rehoboam would not be persuaded. On St. Barnabas&#8217;
Day he rode through Dublin with 140 armed retainers, each
wearing a silken fringe on his helmet, a mode of decoration
which gave Offaly the name by which he is best remembered.
Passing through Dame&#8217;s Gate the Geraldines forded the Liffey
and rode to St. Mary&#8217;s Abbey, where he had summoned a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
meeting of the Council. No sooner had the Deputy taken
the chair than his armed followers invaded the council-chamber,
and waited with ill-concealed impatience while their
leader made a speech, in which he declared himself no longer
King Henry&#8217;s officer, and called on all who hated cruelty and
tyranny to join him in open war. He then tendered the
sword of state to the Primate, who besought him with tears
in his eyes not to do so mad and wicked an act. &#8216;They are
not yet born,&#8217; he said, &#8216;that shall hereafter feel the smart of
this uproar.&#8217; The Chancellor&#8217;s speech was probably unintelligible
to most of the intruders; and the effect of it was at
once dispelled by an Irish bard named Nelan, who recited a
long heroic poem in honour of Silken Thomas, and upbraided
him with lingering too long. Stung by this taunt, Offaly
replied that he was much obliged to the Archbishop for his
advice, but that he came to announce his own intention and not
to seek counsel: he then threw down the sword and left the
room. He was now a subject, and the Council at once ordered
his arrest; but the Mayor had no force at his command, and
the rebel was allowed to rejoin his forces on Oxmantown
Green. Archbishop Alen, who had good reasons for fear, took
refuge in the castle, and the Chief Baron, who accompanied
him, wrote to Cromwell for help.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Butlers remain
loyal.</div>

<p>It was rumoured that Offaly would destroy everything in
the Pale, so that no support might remain for a royal army:
he gave out that he would kill or banish everyone born in
England, and declared forfeit the goods of all who remained
loyal. He wrote to his cousin Lord Butler, offering to divide
Ireland with him if he would help to conquer it; but Butler,
one of the ablest of his race, declined with proper indignation.
He refused to barter his truth for a piece of Ireland,
and was not at all disposed to hang for good fellowship.
&#8216;Were it so,&#8217; he wrote &#8216;(as it cannot be), that the chickens
you reckon were both hatched and feathered; yet be thou
sure, I had rather in this quarrel die thine enemy than live
thy partner.&#8217; Ossory had left the King but a few days before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
having undertaken for himself and his son to assist to their
utmost power the due course of law, and above all strenuously
to resist the usurped jurisdiction of the Bishop of
Rome. Skeffington was again Deputy, and Ossory promised
to maintain his authority. The Government was in fact
placed to a great extent under the protection of the House of
Ormonde. In return for these promises, and in consideration
of the singular confidence and trust which the King had conceived
in the Earl and his son, and in respect of the truth
which always had continued in them and their blood to the
Crown of England, and as a token of confidence in their
ability, the Government of Tipperary and Kilkenny, and of
other districts at the Deputy&#8217;s discretion, were granted to
Ossory and his son. They were not the men to renounce
such solid advantage for the shadowy realm which their rash
kinsman offered.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Murder of
Archbishop
Alen.</div>

<p>It would have been well for Archbishop Alen had he
adhered to his first resolution of remaining inside the castle
walls, which, as it turned out, were quite able to protect him.
Six weeks after the first outbreak, and while the rebels were
threatening Dublin, he put himself under the guidance of
Bartholomew Fitzgerald, a confidential servant, who brought
a small boat to Dame&#8217;s Gate. The Archbishop embarked, but
the wind was contrary and perhaps the boatmen hostile; at
all events, the boat stuck fast on the sands at Clontarf. The
fugitive took refuge in a gentleman&#8217;s house at Artane; but
Offaly appeared at the door next morning and ordered two of
his followers, John Teeling and Nicholas Wafer, to bring out
the Archbishop. They dragged the old man out of bed, and
brought him before their leader. Alen begged for mercy,
acknowledging that his captor had no reason to wish him
well, but claiming regard for his office if not for his person.
Offaly turned away contemptuously, and, speaking in Irish,
ordered his men to &#8216;take away the churl.&#8217; Teeling and Wafer
immediately dashed out the Archbishop&#8217;s brains. Robert
Reyley, who, if not actually an eye-witness, must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
close at hand, was at once sent off to Maynooth with a casket
which was found on Alen&#8217;s person, and he afterwards swore
that he did not know whether Offaly ordered the murder or
not. The rebel chief always maintained that his intention
was to detain and not to kill; but he thought it necessary to
send his chaplain to Rome to seek absolution.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dublin is
threatened.</div>

<p>The sword of state which should have protected them
having been exchanged for a rod to scourge them, the citizens
of Dublin were left to their own slender resources. Instigated
by Offaly, and assisted by John Burnell of Balgriffin, a gentleman
of the Pale, the O&#8217;Tooles descended from their mountains
and ravaged the flat country to the north of the city. In an
attempt to intercept the raiders on their return, the citizens
were defeated with great loss near Kilmainham. Assuming
that they were at his mercy, Offaly offered the citizens their
lives if they would let him enter to besiege the castle. John
White, the Constable, who was afterwards knighted for his
services, made no objection provided he were allowed time to
victual. A spirited Alderman, John Fitzsimons, furnished a
great part of the provisions<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> at his own expense, and also
employed a smith in his own house to forge a chain for the
drawbridge. To such a state of destitution had Geraldine
ascendency brought the principal royal fortress in Ireland.
Another Alderman, Francis Herbert, was sent off to beg help
from the King.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Defence of
Dublin.</div>

<p>White having announced himself ready, the citizens admitted
about 100 of the rebels under the command of James
Field of Lusk, who had with him Teeling and Wafer, the
Archbishop&#8217;s murderers, and three noted pirates, named
Brode, Rookes, and Purcell. The ordnance at Field&#8217;s command,
part of that which had been entrusted to the late Earl
of Kildare for the defence of the realm, was too light to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
any great impression on the castle, upon whose walls it ought
to have been mounted; and in the meantime Ossory was
sweeping away the cattle from Kildare. The temptation to
retaliate was too strong for Offaly, or perhaps for his men,
and he turned aside from Dublin to punish the Butlers.
Tullow Castle delayed him for five precious days, after which
he had the satisfaction of slaughtering the garrison, and five
more days were spent in inaction on the Barrow. Again did
Offaly offer to divide Ireland, including even his own inheritance,
with Ossory; but the Earl refused as his son had done,
and only consented to a truce which would leave him free to
defend Tipperary against a threatened attack from Desmond.
The Butler forces being thus divided, and help having come
from O&#8217;Neill, Offaly broke the truce and began to plunder
Kilkenny. At Thomastown Lord Butler was wounded in a
skirmish, and had to retire to Dunmore until cured; while
Offaly, who had possession of Athy, Kilkea, Carlow, and
Castledermot, collected a great host of O&#8217;Mores, O&#8217;Connors,
Kavanaghs, and O&#8217;Byrnes. But these auxiliaries do not seem
to have been of much use; for Ossory had still men enough
to burn and spoil the northern part of Carlow, though not to
attempt the relief of Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The rebels
are beaten
off.</div>

<p>Francis Herbert returned very speedily from the King,
bringing letters in which Henry promised immediate succour.
Despairing of success, Field anticipated the action of Rosen
at Londonderry, and threatened to expose the citizens&#8217; children
on the trenches, so as to prevent the garrison from using their
guns. Indignant at this breach of faith, and encouraged by
the near prospect of relief, the citizens shut their gates and
seized most of those who were besieging the castle. A few
escaped across the river, and brought the news to Offaly, who
returned to Dublin only to find it bent upon the most desperate
resistance. Having summoned the city in vain, he cut the
leaden pipes which supplied it with water; but there must
have been wells also, for no effects followed. He then besieged
the castle from Ship Street, where there was cover for his men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
but White had some fireworks, which enabled him to burn
down the thatched houses of the suburb and give his guns full
play. Herbert distinguished himself by shooting twenty-four
of the enemy, including one of their chief leaders. Being thus
driven from the castle, Offaly attempted the city wall from
Thomas Street, demolishing the party walls of the houses so
as to make two covered galleries leading up to the New Gate.
One of his shots pierced the gate and killed a man who was
trying to get water at a pipe in the middle of the Corn Market.
A remarkable feat is recorded of Staunton, the gaoler or warder
of New Gate. Having galled the rebels by his sharp-shooting,
he had become a particular mark for their fire, and he saw a
musketeer trying to cover him. He not only shot him in the
forehead, but, notwithstanding the hail of bullets issued from
the gate, stripped the dead man, and brought his gun and
clothes into the town. The Geraldines then tried to burn
the gate; but a sally of the besieged through the smoke and
flame made them suppose that the city had been relieved, and
they withdrew precipitately, leaving a piece of artillery and
100 dead behind them. Offaly lingered for the night in the
precincts of the Grey Friary, from which Francis Street takes
its name, and next day rejoined his men, who had believed
him dead. He made no attempt to renew the siege.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The citizens
refuse
to help the
rebels.</div>

<p>In this, as in so many other Irish insurrections, there
was no want of double traitors; of men who had neither the
constancy to remain loyal nor the courage to persevere in
rebellion. Many of the arrows shot over the walls were headless,
and some bore letters which revealed to the garrison
every plan of the besiegers. The children of the citizens,
whom he had hitherto detained as hostages, could now be of
no use to Offaly, and he exchanged them for some of his own
men who had been captured. He tried to get money, ammunition,
and other help from the citizens in return for raising
the siege; but the men of Dublin knew their advantage, and
answered that they had no money to spare. They argued
that if his intentions were loyal he had no need of warlike
stores, and that to supply him might be to make a rod for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
their own backs. They were, however, willing to supply him
with enough parchment to engross his pardon upon, and to
join him in begging humbly for it. Having neither powder
nor shot, Offaly could not retort to any purpose, and he withdrew
to put his ancestral castle of Maynooth in a posture of
defence.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reinforcements
arrive from
England.</div>

<p>Besides retaining some of the citizens&#8217; children, the rebels
had captured Chief Justice Luttrell and Lord Howth. A
truce was therefore concluded for six weeks, but Offaly broke
it within twenty-four hours by burning corn belonging to the
Prior of Kilmainham. Meanwhile Skeffington had sailed
from North Wales. The bulk of his fleet and army were
intended for Waterford, but Sir William Brereton and Captain
Salisbury were detached with 400 men for the relief of Dublin.
Brereton took command of the city, and saw that proper
watch was kept. Shortly afterwards eighty Northern spearmen
under Musgrave and Hamerton landed or were driven
ashore at Clontarf, where the rebels met them in great force.
They were perhaps picked men, for their white coats and red
crosses are particularly mentioned: at all events, they made
a gallant resistance, and Offaly was wounded. Musgrave and
Hamerton were both killed, and the rebel chief is said to have
mourned deeply for the former, who was his cousin. The
main force of the insurgents hung about the Hill of Howth
in hope of preventing other English troops from landing, and
Brode, Purcell, and Rookes cruised in the offing with their
piratical vessels.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of
Skeffington.</div>

<p>Although the wind served well for Ireland, Skeffington,
who was old and delicate, delayed long at Beaumaris. The
North-countrymen, on whom he placed his chief reliance,
chafed at the delay; and many of their horses, which were
perhaps not very well stowed, died from being cooped up on
board ship for three weeks. At last, on the very day on
which the siege of Dublin was raised, the Lord-Deputy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
sailed. The fleet was driven by a gale under Lambay, where
a report reached it that Dublin had fallen. The news was
not believed, but Brereton and Salisbury were detached.
They reached the Liffey without any difficulty; and there
was no reason why Skeffington should not have done so, but
that he had made up his mind to go to Waterford. As it
was, he was able to lie close to Skerries and to send in his
boats, which burned four Geraldine vessels at anchor in the
roads. The fleet then made sail again, and was again driven
under Lambay, whence two ships made chase after Brode,
the pirate, and drove him ashore near Drogheda. At last
the Lord Deputy was persuaded to take the obvious course,
and landed safely at Dublin more than a week after Brereton.
Other troops from Bristol, under Sir John St. Loo, reached
Waterford about the same time. Messengers were at once
sent to Drogheda, and Brode and his crew were brought by
sea to Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Offaly is
proclaimed
a traitor.</div>

<p>Driven from Dublin, Offaly threatened Drogheda with some
400 horse, but Skeffington, with unwonted energy, marched
the whole distance in one day, and the rebels did not venture
to attack him. The Geraldine chief was proclaimed traitor
at the market-cross, and the gentlemen of Louth and Meath,
finding that there was again something in the shape of a
government, came in fast to the Lord-Deputy. Meanwhile
Ossory and St. Loo were at work in the south, and agreed
to meet Skeffington at Kildare&#8217;s castle of Kilkea. The Earl
and the English knight kept their appointment, but the
Deputy was again ill, and without artillery nothing could
be done. Ossory had enough to do to keep the O&#8217;Mores
and Kavanaghs in check, but he gained one important ally
in the person of Sir Thomas Eustace, of Baltinglass, who
brought forty of his kinsmen and left hostages in the Earl&#8217;s
hands. Eustace kept his word, and received a peerage for
his services, an honour forfeited in Elizabeth&#8217;s time for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
rebellion, which, if one of the most foolish, was also one of
the least selfish of the many recorded in Irish annals.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
rebellion
continues.</div>

<p>During the greater part of the winter Offaly ranged up
and down the Pale, not sparing the Kildare estates, which
he was not likely ever to enjoy in peace. On one occasion
he came into collision with Brereton near Trim, and lost 150
men; but when a garrison of forty men were left in the town
he had no difficulty in recapturing it, and a garrison of
twenty men failed to hold Kildare against him. His following
was reduced to 100 horse and 300 kerne, who had
scarcely a dozen muskets among them; but with this band
he wandered where he pleased, even to the walls of Dublin.
Skeffington again fell sick, and the army was detained doing
nothing in Dublin; he could not, according to Sir John
Alen, do anything himself, and he would not let anyone else
have the credit. A truce for three weeks was concluded with
the rebel, and after the New Year some of the troops were
allowed to leave the capital. Sir Rice Maunsell with 500
men occupied Trim&mdash;Brereton and Salisbury lay at Newcastle;
and preparations were made for assuming the offensive as
soon as the Lord-Deputy should be able to mount a horse.
But there was great want of money, and the ill-paid soldiers
took little interest in any service which did not bring them
profit. They took it on themselves to find men guilty of
treason and to seize their goods, &#8216;whereas,&#8217; as Alen grimly
suggested, &#8216;the King might have them by another mean.&#8217;
Munitions of war were as scarce as money, and the bows
which were sent from Ludlow Castle snapped when the
archers tried to bend them.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of

<p>In the meantime the ecclesiastics who administered the
vacant see of Dublin pronounced sentence of excommunication
in its most tremendous form against the murderers of
the Archbishop. Offaly himself, his uncles John and Oliver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Captain Rookes, James Delahide, and Teeling and Wafer,
who seem to have been the actual murderers, were mentioned
by name. Leprosy and madness, hunger and thirst were
invoked upon them in this life, and eternal damnation in the
life to come. No house was to shelter them, no church to
give them sanctuary, no kind Christian to bestow on them a
morsel of bread when starving, nor a cup of cold water when
dying of thirst, on pain of being considered accessories to
their crime and accursed like them. They were to be partakers
with Pharaoh and Nero, Herod and Judas, Dathan
and Abiram; and stones were cast towards their dwellings,
as by Moses when he called down Divine wrath upon the
last named. It is said that a copy of this curse was
cruelly shown to the old Earl in the Tower, and that the
shock snapped the enfeebled thread which still bound him to
life. The fate of the seven excommunicated persons was
nearly as bad as the most vindictive priest could wish. The
three Geraldines were hanged at Tyburn, Rookes was hanged
at Dublin, Teeling and Wafer died at Maynooth of a horrible
disease, James Delahide escaped to Spain and gave the
Government some further trouble, but he died an exile in
Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

space allowed him by the Deputy&#8217;s inaction to cast about for
allies. He sent Dominick Power to the Emperor, armed
with gifts, and with documents going to prove that Ireland
was a fief of the Holy See and that it was forfeited on
account of Henry&#8217;s heresy. Kildare was ready to hold the
country of Pope or Emperor and to pay tribute, in consideration
of being protected against the English schismatics.

Westmeath, and Con O&#8217;Brien, chief of Thomond, was already
in communication with Charles V., but Con&#8217;s son Donogh
had married Lady Ellen Butler, and Ossory had enough influence
with his son-in-law to keep him to his allegiance.
Donogh, as was usual with the sons of Irish chiefs, had a
strong party of his own, and prevented the clan from stirring.
Ossory contrived to make the Burkes threaten the O&#8217;Kellies,
and they also were neutralised.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Skeffington, having awoke to the fact that Ireland could

Maunsell and Brereton to divide their forces and to burn
most of the Geraldine villages, including Maynooth. While
gaining strength himself he had the satisfaction of ordering
several executions in Dublin. Brode, who was called the
traitor&#8217;s admiral; Rookes, who was captured near Wexford
with some of the royal ordnance in his possession; a third
rover named Purcell, who had been bold enough to cut a
vessel out of the Thames; and Travers, Chancellor of St.
Patrick&#8217;s, who had been an agent in the attempted reduction
of Dublin, were all duly hanged, drawn, and quartered on
Oxmantown Green.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Maynooth
Castle

<p>Brereton summoned Maynooth Castle, proposing to let
the garrison depart with bag and baggage, and offering pardons
and rewards. But they trusted in their walls, and answered
only with taunts and jeers. At last Skeffington left
Dublin and encamped before the castle, which he invested
closely the next day. He pronounced it to be the strongest
fortress which had ever been in Ireland since the English
first set foot there. No detailed account of the armament
has been preserved, but there were several pieces of cannon
and a garrison of over 100, of whom about one-half were
gunners. Christopher Paris, the Earl&#8217;s foster-brother, commanded
within the castle. Skeffington&#8217;s batteries opened
on the third day after his arrival, and soon silenced the guns
on the north-west side of the keep. The guns were then
pointed against a new work on the northern side, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
five days&#8217; bombardment the breach was pronounced practicable.
Paris, who probably despaired of maintaining his
post, now thought it time to make separate terms for himself,
and shot out a letter in which he offered to sell his
post for money. The garrison were accordingly allowed to
sally forth and to capture a small piece of artillery. Paris pretended
great satisfaction, and served out abundant liquor to
his men, who proceeded to celebrate their triumph by getting
drunk. In the first grey light of morning the outwork was
occupied almost without resistance, and the warders were
aroused from their slumbers by shouts of &#8216;St. George! St.
George!&#8217; Ladders were quickly planted against the walls
of the keep, and the storming party began to ascend. Captain
Holland, who was one of the first to reach the parapet,
jumped down into a tub of feathers, but Brereton&#8217;s company
had scaled the walls at another place, and the Geraldines,
completely surprised and only half sober, made but a short
stand. An arrow was discharged at Holland, the weight of
whose armour kept him fast in the feathers, but it missed
him, and he was released in time to take an active part in
the final struggle. Brereton himself ran up to the highest
turret and hoisted a flag, which told the Lord-Deputy that
all was over.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Maynooth

Story of
Paris.</div>

<p>When Skeffington entered in the evening two singing-men
of the Earl&#8217;s chapel prostrated themselves before him,
plaintively chanting a hymn or song called &#8216;Dulcis amica,&#8217;
which affected the victors as the verses of Euripides affected
the Dorians at Syracuse. They were pardoned, and Paris
then came forward to claim his reward. Skeffington allowed
that he had been useful, and promised that the King would
not let him starve; he then asked what confidence the Earl
of Kildare placed in his foster-brother, and Paris enumerated
the benefits which he had received from the fallen family.
&#8216;Couldst thou,&#8217; said the Deputy sternly, &#8216;find in thine heart
to betray his castle who has been so good to thee? Truly,
thou that art so hollow to him wilt never be true to us.&#8217;
Then turning to his officers he ordered them to pay down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
stipulated price, and to execute the traitor forthwith. &#8216;My
lord,&#8217; said the wretched man, &#8216;had I wist you would have
dealt so straitly with me, your lordship should not have
won this fort with so little bloodshed as you did.&#8217; Among
the bystanders was James Boys, formerly Constable of Maynooth,
who had resigned his office at the breaking out of the
rebellion, but who may have sympathised with his old employers,
and who muttered &#8216;too late&#8217; in Irish, a saying which
became proverbial for an ineffectual repentance. Paris was
executed, and it does not appear that he had been promised
pardon, but Skeffington&#8217;s action was neither honest nor politic.
He had profited by the treason, and to kill the traitor could
only tend to make other rebels desperate. About forty other
prisoners were taken, of whom twenty-five were executed,
including the Dean of Kildare and another priest named
Walsh. It appeared from the depositions of one prisoner, a
priest, that there had been negotiations with the Emperor,
who held out hopes of 10,000 men, and also with the King
of Scots. The &#8216;pardon of Maynooth&#8217; became a proverbial
expression for the gallows.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Irish

<p>Kildare had in the meantime succeeded in raising an
army of 7,000 men among the O&#8217;Connors of Offaly and in
Connaught, but the news that Maynooth had fallen almost
dispersed it. With the men who remained he advanced to
Clane, where he came into collision with Skeffington, who
took 140 prisoners and put them to the sword, on a renewal
of the fight being threatened. Kildare then went into
Thomond, intending to sail for Spain, but sent James Delahide
and Robert Walsh, the parish priest of Loughseedy, in
his stead. These messengers joined Power at Cadiz, but did
not obtain an interview with Charles until after their chief&#8217;s
execution. Power was pardoned at the Emperor&#8217;s request,
but the others were attainted by name. Kildare&#8217;s allies now
gradually dropped away. O&#8217;More and MacMurrough gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
security to Ossory, and the Earl&#8217;s followers dwindled daily,
though he continued to roam about in the neighbourhood of
his ancestral estates. Maynooth was too strong to attempt,
but he twice took Rathangan, so that no Englishman would
take charge of it; and Skeffington was forced to entrust it to
Sir James Fitzgerald. After this, Kildare drove a herd of
cattle under the walls, and by the hope of booty drew out a
great part of the garrison, whom he cut to pieces. On one
occasion, he destroyed part of the garrison of Trim by putting
forward some English troopers, who pretended to be Salisbury&#8217;s
men; and on another, he almost succeeded in capturing
a large convoy near Naas. But such stratagems could
not long delay the end, and the Irish saw that the game was
up. O&#8217;Neill came to Skeffington at Drogheda, and took the
oath of allegiance. It was agreed among other things that
any O&#8217;Neill who did wrong within the obedient districts
might be tried by English law, and that homicides should
not be compounded by money payments;<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> but the King&#8217;s
subjects taken in O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s country were to be reserved for
the royal consideration, and not punished capitally by the
chief. O&#8217;Neill was to receive his customary black-rent, but
none of his clans were to levy Irish exactions,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> or to graze
cattle in the English districts. All Englishmen were to
enjoy free trade with Tyrone, and O&#8217;Neill undertook to help
Skeffington in his hostings in as ample a manner as any of
his predecessors had helped any previous Lord-Deputy or
Lord-Lieutenant.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">But
Skeffington
makes little
progress.</div>

<p>O&#8217;More, an able man, who was anxious to deserve well of
his new friends, accompanied Brabazon into the wastes of
Allen, where Kildare was lurking. After the usual plundering,
he advised the Englishmen to turn as if in full retreat,
but, in reality, to occupy all the passes, while the O&#8217;Mores
engaged the Earl&#8217;s party in the plain. But the Northumberland
moss-troopers under Dacre and Musgrave had not
forgotten their old habits, and made off with the booty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
leaving an unguarded pass, through which the Geraldines escaped.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
The O&#8217;Mores would not kill Kildare&#8217;s men, but were
very active against the O&#8217;Connors; indeed, the Earl was believed
to have been in O&#8217;More&#8217;s hands for a time, and to have been
purposely released. But Brabazon took Burnell of Balgriffin,
one of the original advisers of the rebellion, and William
Keatinge, captain of the Keatinge kerne, who had hitherto
been the rebels&#8217; chief strength. The latter was released on
giving security, but Burnell was reserved for the scaffold.
The remarkable unfitness of Skeffington for the post in which
Henry maintained him was strikingly shown at this time.
He was unable to stir from Maynooth, and seemed half dead
if he rose before ten or eleven o&#8217;clock. Marauding bands
came with impunity to the castle gates, and stole the Deputy&#8217;s
horses; and he allowed the army to lie in the open country
without orders, and to consume provisions instead of fighting.
The sick man was jealous of Lord Leonard Grey, the marshal
of the army, whom rumour had designated as his successor;
he was himself incapable of action, and was unwilling to let
others act in his stead.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Surrender
of Kildare.</div>

<p>Before his release Keatinge undertook to drive the Geraldine
chief out of Kildare. The wretched peasants crept
back to their fields to save what was left of the harvest; and
Cahir O&#8217;Connor, who saw how things were likely to end,
came to Grey and Brabazon, and took an oath to defend the
King&#8217;s interests against Kildare, and against his own brother.
The Earl had a stronghold in a boggy wood near Rathangan,
fortified with earthworks and wet ditches, and almost impregnable
had it been well manned and armed. Not being
defended it was easily taken, and whatever would burn was
burned. At last Skeffington felt well enough to take the
field, and advanced with Grey and Butler to the borders
of Offaly. Despairing of the cause, and anxious to save his
harvest, O&#8217;Connor came in and submitted to the Lord Deputy
at Castle Jordan; and Kildare, finding himself alone, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
surrendered to Butler and Grey in the presence of three witnesses.
Skeffington positively asserts that no condition was
made, &#8216;either of pardon, life, land, or goods;&#8217; and this is
confirmed by a despatch from the Council sent three days
later and signed by Lords Butler and Delvin, Rawson, Prior
of Kilmainham, Saintloo, Brabazon, Aylmer, Salisbury, and
Sir Rice Maunsell, the last two having been present at the
surrender. But the councillors admitted that &#8216;comfortable
words were spoken to Thomas to allure him to yield,&#8217; and
begged the King to spare his life according to the comfort of
those words.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The surrender
was unconditional.</div>

<p>A great effort was made to cause a belief in England that
the surrender was conditional, but it does not appear that
the prisoner himself made any such assertion. He wrote to
his connection Grey, confessing himself a rebel, but urging
that he had done all by the advice of Thomas Eustace and
Sir Gerald MacShane. He begged intercession for his life
and lands: failing the efficacy of such aid, he had, he said,
only to shift for himself as he best could. Writers favourable
to the Geraldines have nevertheless stated that he was
promised his life, and this has been copied into a long succession
of popular manuals. Even at the time, the legal
mind of Lord Chancellor Audeley refused to believe that the
Irish Council had so dealt &#8216;with so errant and cankered a
traitor.&#8217; &#8216;If this,&#8217; he added, &#8216;be intended that he should
have mercy, I marvel much that divers of the King&#8217;s Council
in Ireland have so largely told the King, afore this time,
that there should never be good peace or order in Ireland
till the blood of the Garrolds were wholly extinct. And it
was also said that the Irishmen spared their effectual diligence
in the persecution of him, because they heard that he should
have pardon, and then he would revenge; and now it seemeth
they would procure him mercy. They be people of a strange
nature and much inconstancy.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

Elizabeth at her best, and very creditable to Henry, who
declares his unabated confidence in Skeffington, and promises
to make every allowance for his age and infirmities. As to
the disposal of the prisoner, not only Audeley but Norfolk,
who spoke from the fulness of his Irish experience, thought
he should be sent to the Tower and executed in due course,
&#8216;except it should appear that by his keeping alive there
should grow any knowledge of treasons, or other commodity
to the King&#8217;s grace.&#8217; The Duke advised a long respite, lest
Lord Butler and Lord Leonard Grey should lose all their
credit in Ireland. The Chancellor wished to proceed in the
King&#8217;s Bench under the new Statute of Treasons, by which he
considered that such offences, though committed in Ireland,
might be tried in an English shire. Had this opinion finally
prevailed, modern Ireland might be easier to govern than it
ever seems likely to be. Both Norfolk and Audeley allude to
the report that Kildare had been promised his life, but neither
they nor the King confirm it.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Desmonds
and
MacCarthies.</div>

<p>Having followed the fortunes of the House of Kildare
until their great eclipse, we may now turn to the southern
Geraldines, who had also entered upon the slippery paths of
rebellion. The dispute between Desmond and Ormonde was
of old standing, the real cause of it being the fact that
Munster was not large enough to hold two such families.
In 1520 Surrey brought about a meeting at Waterford between
James, the eleventh Earl of Desmond, and Sir Piers
Butler. They were solemnly sworn to keep the peace and to
help each other on lawful occasions. Cormac Oge MacCarthy,
Lord of Muskerry, and MacCarthy Reagh, who had allied
themselves with the Butlers as a defence against their great
neighbours&#8217; oppressions, were parties to this agreement. Surrey
took hostages from them, and reported that they were wise
men and more conformable than some Englishmen. If the
King would undertake to protect them, he thought that they
and many other Irishmen would be content to hold their
lands of him. The peace was short; for Desmond no sooner
got back to his own country than he proceeded to waste
Muskerry with fire and sword. The two MacCarthies joined
their forces, and a pitched battle was fought at Mourne Abbey,
near Mallow. Cormac Oge placed the cavalry under the command
of his sister&#8217;s husband, Thomas Moyle Fitzgerald, who
was Desmond&#8217;s uncle and heir presumptive; and to his charge
the Geraldine partisans of course attribute the result. The
Earl was totally defeated: &#8216;and of this overthrow,&#8217; wrote the
family historian more than a century later, &#8216;the Irish to this
day do brag, not remembering how often both before and
after they received the like measure from the Geraldines.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond

<p>Two years after the fight at Mourne Abbey Desmond was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
in secret communication with Francis I., the Constable
Bourbon having at the same time similar relations with
Henry VIII. The French King sent two agents to Ireland&mdash;Francis
de Candolle, Lord of Oisy, who afterwards appears
as having a relationship or connection with Desmond, and
Francis de Bergagni. They met the Earl at Askeaton, and
made a convention with him. Desmond agreed to make war
on the King, provided that his father-in-law Tirlough O&#8217;Brien
and others of that clan should be included in any peace made
between England and France. Francis rather oddly undertook
to send ships to help Desmond in collecting tribute from
his subjects. The Earl and his seneschal David MacMorris
were promised French pensions, and both Geraldines and
O&#8217;Briens were encouraged to expect French help in any
emergency. Richard de la Pole, Edward IV.&#8217;s exiled nephew,
was to be set up against Henry, and Desmond undertook to
support the Pretender with 400 horse and 10,000 foot, which
were to remain under his command. If he succeeded in
raising 15,000 foot Francis agreed to pay two angelots a
month for every fully armed man, and one angelot for every
kerne. Kinsale, Cork, or Youghal was to be held by the
French, and Desmond promised to use his exertions in providing
them with horses. The convention was ratified at St.
Germain-en-Laye, but nothing whatever came of it. Had
there been any good understanding between Desmond and
the Scots who were threatening Ulster, a powerful diversion
might have been effected; but the Earl seems to have had no
higher object than the enhancement of his own local authority.
Some years later a bill was prepared for the attainder of
Desmond in the Irish Parliament, which recited his treason
in giving aid and comfort to Frenchmen while France and
England were at war. But no Parliament was then held,
and Desmond died unattainted.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>During his short administration after Surrey&#8217;s departure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Sir Piers Butler, who had heard of Desmond&#8217;s dealings with
France, invaded his country with the consent of many loyal
Geraldines. The port towns closed their gates to the rebellious
Earl, who turned upon Tipperary, and occupied the
strong castle of Cahir, the same which afterwards delayed
Essex and thus contributed to his fall. The Deputy hastened
to the spot, and seized the bridge leading to the fortified
island; but the bridge on the other side remained open and
Desmond escaped. After this the O&#8217;Briens, whom many supposed
to be instigated by Kildare, laid a trap for Sir Piers
very like that in which his famous grandson was long afterwards
caught. A parley was proposed at the ford of Camus
on the Suir, and thither, according to his own account, Butler
repaired with a slender escort and the most pacific intentions.
The O&#8217;Briens, who were hidden in a wood, suddenly rushed
out and attacked him, but his men fought bravely and killed
Teig O&#8217;Brien, the chief&#8217;s son, &#8216;of all men of his age the most
dreaded by his enemies.&#8217; The Ormonde district at this time
lay open on account of a bridge which the O&#8217;Briens had lately
built over the Shannon, and one of the complaints against
Kildare was that he had not helped Sir Piers to destroy this
bridge.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Their disputes
about
Dungarvan.</div>

<p>A war without much plan or apparent purpose continued
to rage for years between the Butlers and the southern Geraldines.
In 1527 James Butler wrote to his father, who was
then in England, giving him an account of certain intrigues
and disturbances, and telling him plainly that it was folly
trying to look after Irish affairs in London. He who would
do the King service must do it on the spot. Sir John Fitzgerald
of Decies, who had taken part against the head of his
house, and had in consequence lost much cattle and seen many
farm-houses in flames, watched his opportunity, and shut up
Desmond in Dungarvan. Here he was joined by Butler, and
by the Earl&#8217;s cousin, Thomas Fitzgerald of Decies; but the
castle defied anything short of a regular siege. Butler had a
horse shot under him, but a sally was unsuccessful, and Des<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>mond
thought it prudent to take the sea with forty men.
He sailed into Youghal upon the flood-tide, and Dungarvan
then offered to surrender to Sir Thomas Fitzgerald. Butler
refused to allow this, and Sir Thomas then joined his cousin,
who had begun to ravage his lands about Youghal. The prey
having escaped, Dungarvan was not thought worth any further
immediate trouble; but a grant of the offices of governor,
constable, and steward of the place was soon afterwards
passed to Sir Piers Butler on his being created Earl of Ossory.
The condition was imposed that the new Earl should seek
to recover Dungarvan out of Desmond&#8217;s possession.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

immigration
into
Wales.</div>

<p>The rebel seems to have been a man of large ideas. He
had the Archbishop of Cashel, a natural son of Ossory, to
watch over his interests at Court, and something amounting
almost to an Irish invasion of England took place under his
auspices. In twelve months the almost incredible number
of 20,000 Irishmen are said to have landed in Pembrokeshire&mdash;that
little England beyond Wales whence the
ancestors of the Geraldines had first sailed to Ireland. They
spread themselves over the country about Milford Haven and
between St. David&#8217;s and Tenby, and the very corporation of
the latter town came under Irish influence. A townsman had
two large heavily armed ships manned by Irishmen: he was
himself Welsh, but he would have neither Welshman nor
Englishman on board. Throughout the country side Irishmen
outnumbered the natives in the proportion of four to one, and
many Irish vessels frequented the coast, and were employed
in trade or piracy, or in a mixture of both. Nearly all the
men they brought were from Desmond&#8217;s country, and it is
probable that he had a share of the profits, and that he was
thus enabled to keep up the contest on land.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

intrigues

<p>The adventurous Earl had gained nothing by his alliance
with France; but he did not abandon the hope of foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
intervention in Ireland, and sent a present of Irish hawks
and wolf-hounds to Charles V. The gifts were in charge of
a trusty messenger, who landed at St. Sebastian and hastened
to the Imperial Court at Toledo. Wolsey&#8217;s emissaries
were accurately informed of these movements, and one who
lived at Renteria recommended that a royal cruiser should be
sent to intercept the ambassador on his return. The man
himself lacked discretion, for he showed his despatches to the
papal collector at Valladolid, and their contents thus became
known to the English agents. Desmond&#8217;s great wish was for
artillery, which would have placed nearly every castle in
Munster at his mercy. Glad to find any means of annoying
a King who desired to repudiate his aunt, Charles sent a gold
cup to Desmond, and soon afterwards despatched his chaplain
Gonzalo Fernandez to Ireland. Fernandez, who spoke very
good English, was instructed to make himself thoroughly
acquainted with Desmond&#8217;s resources, and to offer help if he
thought it advisable. He was authorised to promise that the
Earl should be included in any treaties which might be made
between the Emperor and Henry VIII., and to explain that
his master had always been most anxious for the English
King&#8217;s friendship. Notwithstanding his former good offices
Henry had made an alliance with France, and now sought to
divorce his Queen and to give the Duchy of Ireland to his
bastard in disparagement of the Princess Mary. Such proceedings
Charles was determined firmly to resist.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mission of

Fernandez
to Ireland,
1529.</div>

<p>Fernandez left Toledo on March 3, the Spanish Government
giving out that he had gone to England to recover
debts due to the Emperor. He had returned by April 28.
On his way out he touched at Cork, where many persons
visited his ship, and he gathered from their conversation
that Desmond was not popular there. After this he was
driven into Berehaven, whence he wrote to the Earl; and in
four days he received an answer directed to him as chaplain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
to &#8216;our sovereign lord the Emperor,&#8217; Desmond striving to
assume the position of an Imperial feudatory, instead of that
of an English subject. Fernandez then sailed to Dingle,
and before he could land Desmond sent six gentlemen on
board to ask his help in capturing certain English and
French vessels which lay near, probably at Ventry or Smerwick.
Desmond had already sent his galleys, and was going
with 500 men to support them by land. The Spaniard, with
a more exact idea of an ambassador&#8217;s duties than the potentate
to whom he was accredited, prudently excused himself.
Desmond evidently did not wish Fernandez to visit any of
his castles, and preferred to meet him at the water&#8217;s edge.
Anxious to appear a powerful independent prince, he was
probably unwilling that the Spaniards should see the nakedness
of the land and his own rude way of life; and perhaps
he shrunk from accumulating evidence against himself in
case submission to his lawful sovereign should after all become
expedient.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fernandez

<p>On April 21 Fernandez disembarked. He was well received
by the inhabitants and by Desmond himself, who had
500 horse and as many gallowglasses with him. The Earl
asked after the Emperor&#8217;s health, and again called him his sovereign
lord. Fernandez read his commission first in English.
Desmond then requested that it might be repeated in Latin for
the benefit of his Council, and when it was finished he took
off his cap and thanked the Emperor for his gracious condescension,
adding the reflection that his Majesty was placed
on earth to prevent one prince from injuring another. His
evident design was to acknowledge the supremacy of the
Empire over all the kingdoms of the world, and at the same
time to place himself on a level with the King of England,
from whom he held his lands, his title, and his jurisdiction.
Desmond then discharged the congenial duty of magnifying
himself and his ancestors. He was, he said, descended from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Brito, who lawfully conquered the great and the small
Britain, and reduced Ireland and Scotland under his yoke.
It had been prophesied that an Earl of Desmond should conquer
England, and this kept the English in a constant state
of tremor. The fear of its fulfilment had caused the beheading
of Earl Thomas by Lord Deputy Tiptoft, and Richard,
&#8216;son of the King of England,&#8217; had invaded Ireland on
account of his father&#8217;s enmity with the reigning King.
Afterwards that Earl had conquered all Ireland, &#8216;some few
towns only excepted.&#8217; The King of England caused the
Earl of Kildare to be destroyed in prison, until his kinsman
of Desmond forcibly liberated him and made him Viceroy
of Ireland. In twenty-four years, during which he had been
stirring up both English and Irish, first to kill Desmond&#8217;s
father and afterwards to make war on himself, the King of
England had gained no advantage. The Earl&#8217;s servants
trading in France and Flanders had been imprisoned and
despoiled of 9,000<i>l.</i> by the English King&#8217;s orders. Fernandez
prudently demanded that this extraordinary farrago
should be written down. It is very fortunate that he was
unable to retain it in his memory, for no amount of mere
English evidence could give us such a measure of a Desmond&#8217;s
pride, or of the nonsense which rhymers or Brehons could
venture to put into a Desmond&#8217;s head.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond&#8217;s

<p>The Geraldine addressed Charles V. as most invincible
and most sacred Cæsar, ever august; and described himself
as Earl of Desmond, Lord of Decies, of O&#8217;Gunnell, and of
the liberty of Kerry. He first asked for four vessels of 200
tons each, and six smaller ones, all well armed, and for 500
Flemings to work them. Fernandez objected that no consideration
was offered for so great a gift, and that Desmond
could give no security out of Ireland; but ultimately an
article was made out in which the Earl avowed himself the
Emperor&#8217;s subject, and promised to help him in all his enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>prises.
Knowing that no guarantee could be given, the
Spaniard wisely asked for none but his host&#8217;s word of honour.
The Earl declared his fixed intention&mdash;and here at least he
spoke quite sincerely&mdash;to use all his strength and that of his
friends in prosecuting the war against Piers Butler, the
King&#8217;s Deputy, and against the cities of Limerick, Waterford,
and Dublin. He begged the Emperor&#8217;s help, and renewed
his request for cannon; as for men, he could bring
16,500 foot and 1,500 horse into the field, and his allies
could furnish 9,000 additional foot and 300 additional horse.
In enumerating his allies Desmond again drew upon his
imagination, for he included O&#8217;Donnell, Prince of Ulster,
with his 4,000 foot and 800 horse, Maguire and Magennis in
the distant north, as well as the MacCarthies with whom he
was at war, and who, about this time, defeated him in a
pitched battle. He also represented himself as firmly allied
and frequently communicating with the King of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fernandez
is unfavourable
to
Desmond.</div>

<p>Fernandez told his master that Desmond had treated him
well, and supplied his ship with fresh beef and venison. He
had found him full of animosity against Wolsey, and quite
ready to forget his French connections and his former compact
with Francis. But the Earl acknowledged that Dublin
was the chief town of Ireland, and that he had no interest
there, and that his kinsman of Kildare, whom he called the
ruler of the capital, had been imprisoned in the Tower.
That he had been arrested partly on Desmond&#8217;s account
was obviously of less importance than the fact that he could
be arrested at all. As to Cork, Limerick, and Waterford,
Desmond had some friends there, but many more enemies.
On the other hand, the Earl certainly had ten castles, and
Fernandez was made to believe that the King of England
had lately failed to take Dungarvan&mdash;a version of the facts
which strained them considerably. The Spaniard could not
doubt that Desmond had many tributary knights, and much
influence among the wild Irish; but he did not form a high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
opinion of the Earl&#8217;s soldiers, among whom executions for
theft and murder were very frequent. They performed wonderful
feats of horsemanship without saddle or stirrups, but
they had no military skill. There were some gallowglasses
with halberts, but the great mass had only bows and arrows.
Fernandez allows that the Earl kept good justice, but it is
clear that his general impression was unfavourable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
sends messengers
to
Spain. The
English
agents are
well
informed.</div>

<p>Desmond sent John Aslaby, Archdeacon of Cloyne, and
another messenger with Fernandez, and they found their way
to Spain. The English agents there continued to be well
informed, and they learned from one Gwyn, living at Ballinskellig,
in Kerry, and trading to St. Sebastian, that Desmond
had sent for 4,000 men to teach the Irish war. Gwyn
truly reported that Cormac Oge was warring against the
Earl, but that he would probably soon acknowledge himself
beaten. There is reason to believe that a Spanish expedition
to Ireland was really contemplated, but that the Biscayans
intended for the service refused to go, alleging, with
a fine perception of the realities of Celtic diplomacy, that
the Irish would be sure to deceive the Emperor. At all
events nothing was done, and Spanish intervention in Ireland
was put off for half a century. Desmond was proclaimed a
traitor, but he died soon afterwards, and his successor followed
him in a few months, leaving his heritage in dispute.
The mission of Fernandez had no direct effect upon Ireland,
but it may have had a good deal to do with Wolsey&#8217;s fate,
and with the crooked diplomacy of the divorce question. He
was heir to De Puebla, who had negotiated Catherine of
Arragon&#8217;s marriages, and probably knew more than any one
about the brief which Julius II. was said to have sent to
Ferdinand the Catholic, and which, if genuine, would have
precluded Clement VII. from granting a divorce on the
ground of affinity. If the brief was forged, its spuriousness
could not be proved in the absence of Fernandez, and the
delay was fatal to the English Cardinal.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Stephen
Parry&#8217;s
tour in the
south of
Ireland.
Siege of
Dungarvan.</div>

<p>Lord Leonard Grey was sent to England in charge of
Kildare, but he left his company of 100 men, under a Welsh
officer named Parry, with orders to attach himself to Lord
Butler. Parry&#8217;s despatch to Cromwell is one of the very few
contemporary documents which throw light on the state of
the country. He and his men entered Ossory&#8217;s district at
Leighlin Bridge, where the people were glad to see them,
and went on to Callan, where they found English fashions
generally followed. They were so well received at Callan
that they stayed there nine days, and they made a further
halt of three days at Clonmel, which also entertained them
hospitably. Thomas Butler, a man of great local influence,
who had married Ossory&#8217;s daughter, and was afterwards
created Lord Cahir, met the troops at Clonmel and led them
over the mountains to Dungarvan. He spoke very good
English, and made himself most agreeable. Gerald MacShane
Fitzgerald of Decies, who was also Ossory&#8217;s son-in-law, joined
them on the road. This gentleman could not speak a word
of English, but he was very civil, professed great loyalty, and
bound himself by hostages to act under the advice of the
Council. Reaching Dungarvan about the middle of September,
they met Skeffington, who had made up his mind to take
the place, and who brought the artillery which was henceforth
to play so great a part in Irish politics. The accidental
presence of a Devonshire fishing fleet enabled the Lord
Deputy to invest the castle completely. On being summoned
the commandant answered boldly that he held the place for
his master, and that he would do the best for him, as he was
sure Skeffington would in like case do for his master. Two
days were spent in preparing the battery, and at five o&#8217;clock
on the morning of the third the cannonade began. A breach
was made by eleven, and Sir John Saintloo wished to storm
it at once, but Skeffington&#8217;s practised eye detected an inner
barricade. Lord Butler, who was a suitor for the castle, and
had no mind to be at the expense of rebuilding it, here interfered
to prevent a renewal of the fire. He sent in two of his
men as hostages for the constable&#8217;s safety, and the latter then
came out. Partly by coaxing and partly by bullying, Butler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
persuaded him to surrender, and he and his men took the
oath of allegiance and swore to maintain the succession of
Anne Boleyn&#8217;s child. The castle was handed over to Ossory&#8217;s
men.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
dies in 1529.
Disputed
succession.
Parry&#8217;s
journey.</div>

<p>The Earl of Desmond whom Gonzalo Fernandez visited
died in 1529, leaving no male issue, and his uncle and successor
Thomas Moyle soon followed him. Thomas Moyle&#8217;s
son Maurice died before his father, having married Joan
Fitzgerald, daughter of the White Knight, by whom he left
one son, generally called James Fitzmaurice. James would
have succeeded of course, but that the validity of his mother&#8217;s
marriage was disputed. Failing him the next heir would be
his grand-uncle, John Fitz-Thomas, who was at this time a very
old man. To settle this question, if possible, and also, as
Skeffington wrote to the King, &#8216;to execute the succession of
your Highness and of your most excellent Queen&#8217; Anne
Boleyn, the Lord-Deputy issued commissions for all the
southern and western counties, and in each Lord Butler was
named chief commissioner. But the old artilleryman would
not give Butler a single gun, and he continued his journey
without the means of taking castles. At Youghal the townsmen
received him well, and Parry, who evidently liked good
living, notes that claret sold there for fourpence a gallon.
Next day they encamped near Midleton, where the Butlers
mustered 202 horse, 312 gallowglasses, and 204 kerne,
besides a due proportion of the rabble which invariably accompanied
Irish armies. Parry&#8217;s contingent consisted of 78
spearmen, 24 &#8216;long boys,&#8217; and 5 musketeers&mdash;all well horsed.
The next day they reached Cork, and Cormac Oge appeared
with his host on a hill less than a mile from the city.
Drawing up his main body on rising ground fronting the
MacCarthies, Butler descended into the hollow with a few followers,
and the chief of Muskerry met him there similarly
attended. The mayor and aldermen, all in scarlet gowns and
velvet tippets, after the English fashion, were very glad to
see so many Englishmen, and &#8216;made us,&#8217; says Parry, &#8216;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
best cheer that ever we had in our lives.&#8217; Next day Cormac
Oge came into the town accompanied by the young Earl, who
had married his daughter, and who, having been brought
up in England, dressed and behaved in approved fashion.
He acknowledged that he held all from the King, whom he had
never offended; and as a true-born Englishman he was quite
ready to go to England and try his title before his Majesty
in council, provided his grand-uncle Sir John would do the
same. Earl or not, he was at the King&#8217;s disposal for any
service, and to all this Cormac Oge agreed.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Journey of
Parry and
Lord
Butler.
The
O&#8217;Briens.</div>

<p>The youthful Lord Barry, who spoke very good English
and was full of complaints against the MacCarthies for keeping
him out of his lands, also came to Lord Butler at Cork.
Cormac Oge was anxious to have all disputes referred to the
Lord-Deputy; but his son-in-law MacCarthy Reagh, the chief
of Carbery, who came in upon safe-conduct, said that he
would do nothing of the kind, but would hold by the sword
what he had won by the sword. Butler was very angry and
told him he should repent, but MacCarthy doubtless knew
that, however good the will, the power to pursue him into
his own country was wanting. Mallow and Kilmallock,
which Parry found a very poor town, were next visited; and
as the army approached Limerick, O&#8217;Brien evacuated two
castles in the neighbourhood and obstructed the passes into
Thomond with felled trees. Hearing that the invaders had
no cannon he restored his garrison, and encamped with a
large force three miles from the city walls. At Limerick
Parry also found very good cheer, &#8216;but nothing like the cheer
that we had at Cork.&#8217; They then encamped at Adare, where
Donogh O&#8217;Brien, the reigning chief of Thomond&#8217;s eldest son
and the husband of Lady Helen Butler, came to meet his
brother-in-law. The speech attributed to Donogh seems genuine,
and is not without a rude pathos:&mdash;&#8216;I have married your
sister; and for because that I have married your sister, I
have forsaken my father, mine uncle, and all my friends, and
my country, to come to you to help to do the King service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
I have been sore wounded, and I have no reward, nor nothing
to live upon. What would ye have me to do? If that it
would please the King&#8217;s grace to take me unto his service,
and that you will come into the country, and bring with you
a piece of ordnance to win a castle, the which castle is named
Carrigogunnell, and his Grace to give me that, the which
never was none Englishman&#8217;s these 200 year, and I will
desire the King no help, nor aid of no man, but this English
captain, with his 100 and odd of Englishmen, to go with me
upon my father and mine uncle, the which are the King&#8217;s
enemies, and upon the Irishmen that never English man were
amongst; and if that I do hurt or harm, or that there be any
mistrust, I will put in my pledges, as good as ye shall require,
that I shall hurt no Englishman, but upon the wild
Irishmen that are the King&#8217;s enemies. And for all such
land as I shall conquer, it shall be at the King&#8217;s pleasure to
set Englishmen in it, to be holden of the King, as his pleasure
shall be; and I to refuse all such Irish fashions, and to
order myself after the English and all that I can make or
conquer. Of this I desire an answer.&#8217;</p>

<p>That Donogh in offering his services was going directly
against his own family is plain from a letter which his father
had written to Charles V. not much more than a year before.
&#8216;We have,&#8217; he had then said, &#8216;never been subject to English
rule, or yielded up our ancient rights and liberties; and there
is at this present, and for ever will be, perpetual discord between
us, and we will harass them with continual war.&#8217; The O&#8217;Briens
had never sworn fealty to anyone, but he offered full submission
to the Emperor, with 100 castles and 18,000 men.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Desmonds
and
the Irish.</div>

<p>Old Sir John of Desmond, the rival claimant to the title,
also came to Adare and spoke plainly in very good English.
&#8216;What should I do in England,&#8217; he asked, &#8216;to meet a boy
there? Let me have that Irish horson, Cormac Oge, and I
will go into England before the King.&#8217; Parry thought him
as full of mischief as ever; but he agreed to meet the young
Earl at Youghal, and also the obnoxious Cormac. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
curious to see how proud these Desmonds were of their Norman
blood, and how they despised the Irish; while often
straining every nerve against Henry II.&#8217;s successor, offering
their allegiance to foreign princes, and boasting to them of
their Irish allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parry&#8217;s observations.</div>

<p>Returning to Clonmel by Kilmallock and Cashel, Parry
was despatched to bring Vice-Treasurer Brabazon and Chief
Justice Bermingham to a conference with Ossory and his son
at Youghal. During the whole long journey from Dungarvan
he had met no one who had ever seen an English soldier in
those parts. Some days they rode sixteen miles at a stretch
over what had once been really, and still remained nominally,
Englishmen&#8217;s ground. The woods, the rivers, and the rich
grass lands about them excited his admiration. Nor was
there any want of ground suitable for corn, and the ridges
showed that it had once been tilled, but not a blade of oats
had grown there for twelve years. Parry, who had evidently
been very well treated by him, seems to have formed a high
idea of Lord Butler&#8217;s qualifications. If the King would give
him artillery there was scarcely any limit to his possible
services; for his own marriage with a daughter of Desmond
and the marriages of his sisters, no less than his personal
character, gave him great influence throughout the South of
Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord
Leonard
Grey made
Marshal of
the army.
He and
Skeffington
disagree.</div>

<p>Having determined to continue Skeffington in the government
of Ireland, notwithstanding his age and bad health,
Henry took means to supply him with efficient subordinates.
First among them was Lord Leonard Grey, who had returned
with a new commission as marshal and with the title of
Viscount Grane, which, however, he never chose to assume.
The others were Sir John Saintloo, a brave soldier; the Vice-Treasurer
Brabazon, who was already well tried; and John
Alen, Master of the Rolls, who had been pushing his own
interests at Court, and who was entrusted with the royal despatch.
Honest musters leading to a reduction of expenses
were the King&#8217;s great object at this time; for Kildare was
safe in the Tower, and it seemed that a great army was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
longer necessary. Special care was taken to define Grey&#8217;s
position, and Skeffington, whose supremacy as Henry&#8217;s representative
was fully acknowledged, was reminded that royal
blood flowed in the marshal&#8217;s veins. Discipline had been
much relaxed in Ireland, and no doubt reform was wanted; but
Grey seems to have used his military authority with undue
severity. Thomas Dacre, a member of the great northern
family, who came in charge of some spearmen, was imprisoned
for eight days, though nothing had been proved against him.
Another Dacre was confined for seven weeks without any
apparent reason, and during a fortnight he had irons on both
arms and legs. Such proceedings certainly gave some grounds
for supposing that Grey was not disposed to favour those
who had helped to overthrow his rebellious nephew.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death and
character of
Skeffington,
1535.</div>

<p>Skeffington died about two months after Grey&#8217;s return.
Though not very brilliant, he had been on the whole successful,
and had shown that a private gentleman armed with the
King&#8217;s commission could be more than a match for the greatest
of Irish nobles. It was indeed part of Henry&#8217;s policy, as
it had been his father&#8217;s, to rely much upon persons of far
humbler birth. Fox and Wolsey were Churchmen, and the
tonsure had been always powerful to counteract plebeian extraction;
but Empson the pettifogger, Cromwell the clothier,
Stile the scribe, and Tuke, who speculated in kerseys, with
many others of no higher original pretensions, were often
preferred for important affairs to the chiefs of the English
aristocracy. The business was often better done, and the
power of the Crown was brought into more prominent relief.
Skeffington may be regarded as the first of that long line of able
public servants who reduced Ireland to a tardy and unwilling
obedience. &#8216;He was,&#8217; said Brabazon, &#8216;a very good man of
war, but not quick enough for Ireland, and somewhat covetous.&#8217;
The charge was made by others also, and is easier to
make than to refute. But it is certain that Skeffington died
in difficulties, and one fact may be set against many opinions.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord
Leonard
Grey
Deputy,
1536.</div>

<p>Grey was immediately chosen Lord Justice by the Council,
and his patent as Deputy was not long delayed. He began
badly, his temper involving him in one of those personal
difficulties which led to his ruin. He had never been on
good terms with his predecessor, and was at no pains to make
a decent or politic show of regret. Less than a month after
her husband&#8217;s death Lady Skeffington wrote to Anne Boleyn,
declaring that she was overwhelmed with debt through his
liberality in advancing money for the public service. She
had already complained to Cromwell of Grey&#8217;s harshness, and
her son-in-law Anthony Colley went so far as to accuse him of
shortening the late Deputy&#8217;s life. Aylmer and Alen, afterwards
Grey&#8217;s most unrelenting enemies, were included in
Lady Skeffington&#8217;s complaint. The Council now sustained
Grey, but it was not in official documents that the politicians
of Dublin were wont to assail a chief governor whose hand
might after all be heavy against them. Verbal messages and
innuendoes contained in private letters seldom failed to
undermine a man whom it might be neither safe nor decent
to accuse openly. Grey now contented himself with saying
that the late Lord Deputy had died in debt, and that his
property was held in pledge for his creditors. But Lady
Skeffington replied, and no doubt truly, that the official salary
had never been paid, and that she could do nothing without
it. Cromwell at least believed her, for he gave orders that her
goods should be delivered to her, and that she should be sped
on her homeward journey. Grey complied in the most ungracious
manner, and had all the luggage and furniture
turned out of Maynooth Castle before carts could be provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
to carry it away. It was stored in a church, and there further
detained by the new Deputy for a debt to the Crown. Lady
Skeffington was unable to leave for eight or nine months
after her husband&#8217;s death, and obstacles were placed in her
way to the last. There may have been faults on both sides,
but had Grey been either a good-natured or a politic man he
might have found means to smooth matters for a widowed
lady whose chief desire was the very general one of wishing
to get out of Ireland as quickly as possible.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of 1536.</div>

<p>Grey was commissioned to summon a Parliament, which
accordingly met on Monday, May 1, the day before Anne
Boleyn was sent to the Tower. In less than three weeks a
number of important bills were passed, of which drafts carefully
settled by Audeley himself had been sent from England.
The succession was secured to the issue of Anne Boleyn, as
Brabazon wrote only two days before that unfortunate lady&#8217;s
execution. Before the letter reached London Jane Seymour
had already been Queen a full fortnight, and Cromwell&#8217;s concern
was, if possible, to stop the passing of an Act which
would have to be repeated so soon. It was too late to do this,
but the Parliament made no difficulty about enacting the
same stringent rule of succession for the third as they had
done for the second wife. They thus achieved the unique
distinction of passing two contradictory Acts of Settlement
within eighteen months. This remarkable performance does
not adorn the printed statute book, because that compilation
was made when Elizabeth was firmly seated on the throne.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The royal
supremacy.</div>

<p>The bill declaring the King to be supreme head of the
Church encountered some opposition from the proctors of the
clergy, two of whom were summoned to Parliament from each
diocese. The proctors had only consultative voices, but they
now claimed not only to be full members of Parliament, but
to form a separate order whose consent would be necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
every change in the law. An Act was passed declaring them
no members of the body of Parliament, as they had &#8216;temerariously
assumed and usurpedly taken upon them to be.&#8217; In
spite of their opposition and of much secret discontent, a
series of Acts were passed to emancipate the Irish Church
from Roman influences, or rather for subjecting her to King
Stork instead of to King Log. All dues hitherto paid to
Rome were forbidden, and the election and consecration of
bishops were withdrawn from papal control. Appeals were
transferred from the Pope to the King. The payment of first-fruits
was imposed on all secular dignitaries and beneficed
clergymen, abbots and priors being for the time exempted.
The abrogation of this heavy and oppressive tax was reserved
for the energy of Swift or the piety of Anne. By Audeley&#8217;s
advice the English heresy laws were not copied in Ireland. An
Act was passed to validate the proceedings of this Parliament,
though it had been held contrary to Poyning&#8217;s law, but the
spirit if not the letter of that famous measure had been
observed by preparing the bills in England. Indeed, the
Parliament was as subservient as any official could wish.
&#8216;The Common House,&#8217; wrote Brabazon, &#8216;is marvellous good
for the King&#8217;s causes, and all the learned men within the same
be very good; so that I think all causes concerning the King&#8217;s
grace will take good effect.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Act of
Absentees.</div>

<p>The weakening of the English power in Ireland by the
non-residence of great proprietors had long been recognised.
Edward III., on the occasion of his son Lionel&#8217;s mission,
announced by proclamation that the lands of absentees would
be granted to Englishmen willing and able to defend them
against the Irish. An English Parliament under Richard II.
provided that in case of absenteeism the Viceroy and Council
might divert two-thirds of the rents and profits to the defence
of the country in ordinary cases; one-third in the case of
students, of persons absent on the King&#8217;s service, or of those
who had leave of absence under the great seal. Whether or
not this English law was ever re-enacted or obeyed in Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
forfeiture was considered an incident of non-residence, and
special Acts were passed to protect those who left Ireland on
the public service. Henry VI. made a law ordering his subjects
of Ireland to return to their own country. By Poyning&#8217;s
Act the statute of Richard II. obtained full force in Ireland,
and it was shortly afterwards provided afresh that all licences
of absence should be under the great seal of England, exceptions
being made in favour of the religious orders and of
students. The momentous Act now passed declared that
many great proprietors had notoriously failed to defend their
lands, whereby the King was forced to incur great expense
in bringing an army to Ireland. The persons specially
mentioned were Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, and his
coparcener Lord Barkley, who claimed and held the seigniories
and lordships of Carlow, Old Ross, &amp;c.; George Talbot, Earl
of Waterford and Salop, who held the seigniory of Wexford;
and the heirs general of the Earl of Ormonde, who held divers
possessions and lands. To these were added the Abbots of
Furness, Bristol, Osney, and Bath; the Priors of Canterbury,
Lanthony, Cartmel, and Keynsham; and the master of St.
Thomas of Acon in London. All this property was resumed
to the Crown, saving the rights of residents in Ireland, who
held under the dispossessed lords. Wexford was at once
placed under a royal seneschal, and was so governed till the
reign of James I. The Crown thus became one of the
greatest of Irish landlords, and the foundations of a reconquest
were laid.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
O&#8217;Neills.</div>

<p>While Parliament was sitting Phelim O&#8217;Neill, chief of
Clandeboye, came to Dublin and covenanted with the Lord
Deputy to attend all great hostings and to make war upon
all enemies of the Government within a day&#8217;s march of his
own country. He promised not to aid or harbour rebels,
and to submit all differences between his people and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
King&#8217;s subjects to peaceful arbitration. The great Leinster
chief, Cahir MacEncross Kavanagh, also came to terms,
agreed to supply twelve horsemen and twenty kerne in all
hostings, and to employ his whole force on journeys of not
more than three days&#8217; duration. He promised to submit
disputes to the arbitration of Ossory and his son. Redmond
Savage, the chief of an English family in Down which had
long conformed to Celtic usages, made a similar agreement,
and also promised to pay the Lord Deputy for his friendship
100 fat cows and a good horse, or fifteen marks Irish. Grey
went himself to Dundalk, where Con O&#8217;Neill met him. The
chief of Tyrone renewed the promises made to Skeffington,
binding himself to attend all hostings and do his best against
Scotch intruders, but he gave no hostages, and an invasion
of his country was not believed to be practicable. The Lord
Deputy then returned to Dublin, where a new and very
serious danger demanded his presence.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Want of
money.
Mutiny.</div>

<p>&#8216;Lack of money,&#8217; as Grey expressed it, &#8216;after the late
robbing and spoiling,&#8217; was the great difficulty of the English
in Ireland during the whole Tudor period. The King now
sent 7,000<i>l.</i>, but that sum still left the soldiers&#8217; pay three
months in arrear. There were many differences among the
members of Council, but they all agreed in demanding more
money. The northern spearmen, on the report that they
were not to be paid in full, mutinied openly, declaring that
they would have all or none. They refused to hear the
King&#8217;s letter read, threatened the lives of the Vice-Treasurer
and Chief Justice, declared that they would not serve without
wages, and that if they were not paid they would &#8216;board
with the Council at their houses, in spite of their hearts.&#8217;
The astute borderers carried their point, for they received
full payment, while Grey&#8217;s own retainers were sent empty
away. Saintloo&#8217;s men at Waterford also showed a mutinous
spirit, but they were silenced for a time by receiving part of
what was due to them.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Grey
travels
southward.</div>

<p>Parliament having adjourned to Kilkenny, Grey followed
it thither, the army being victualled for a month. Having
made arrangements for restoring the fortifications at Powerscourt,
Woodstock, and Athy, Grey left the defence of the
Pale to Brabazon, adjourned the Parliament to Limerick,
and himself set out for Desmond&#8217;s country. Besides Ossory
and his son and the usual force of the four shires, O&#8217;Carroll,
MacMurrough, O&#8217;Byrne, Lord Roche, and the gentlemen of
Wexford and Waterford, accompanied the Lord Deputy.
He was also attended by William Body, a confidential servant
whom Cromwell had sent over to gather information,
and whom he afterwards mentioned in his will. Body
travelled to Ireland with George Browne, the new Archbishop
of Dublin, and first busied himself in trying to
arrange Grey&#8217;s dispute with Lady Skeffington. He had
particular instructions to inquire as to the possibility of
increasing the Irish revenue.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Desmond
country.
Carrigogunnell.</div>

<p>Marching unopposed across the central plain, Grey found
the great Desmond stronghold on Lough Gur undefended,
the doors and windows having been carried off and the roof
purposely burnt. It was handed over to Lord Butler, who
undertook to repair and garrison it at his own expense.
Grey then marched to Carrigogunnell, an immense fortress
standing in a commanding position over the Shannon.
Matthew O&#8217;Brien surrendered the place on condition, as
was alleged by Body, that it should be garrisoned only by
Englishmen. An order was nevertheless given to hand it
over to Donogh O&#8217;Brien, Ossory&#8217;s son-in-law. This chief
came to Grey and renewed the offers made to Butler. He
was ready to serve the King against his father and all others,
provided he might have Carrigogunnell; and the Council
considered his services more important to them than the
castle could be to him. But the English guard restored
the place to Matthew O&#8217;Brien. Donogh was certainly not
an Englishman, and George Woodward, &#8216;an honest and an
hardy man,&#8217; may have thought himself bound in honour to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
restore the original situation, or he may have thought one
O&#8217;Brien as good as another. Grey merely says that Matthew
held out boldly until the battering train was in position,
when he was content to depart with bag and baggage.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grey attacks
the
O&#8217;Briens,
August,
1536.</div>

<p>The next undertaking was an attack on O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s Bridge,
which had long laid Limerick and Tipperary open to attack.
The bridge was of wood, with a castle at each end built in
the water. That near the Limerick shore was the strongest,
and was of hewn limestone or marble, twelve or fourteen
feet thick, and armed with an iron gun carrying shot as big
as a man&#8217;s head, and two small pieces, of which one belonged
to some ship, and the other was of Portuguese make. The
garrison had also some muskets and hand-guns, and the
work was skilfully strengthened with wooden barriers and
with hogsheads full of sand. Under Donogh O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s
guidance the Lord Deputy marched along the hilly bank
of the great river by devious paths, untravelled hitherto, as
he believed, by Englishmen or by wheels. The four land-arches
had been broken down, and the castle was thus surrounded
by water. The royal artillery consisted of one
culverin, six falcons, and one half-saker, but these were not
heavy enough. In a day and a half all the shot had been
fired away, and the walls were almost as sound as ever. No
baggage train had been brought, provisions were scarce, and
two nights had been spent on the bare ground; it was necessary
to retire or to take the castle. Brushwood was abundant,
and Grey set his men to make fascines and to throw
them into the channel. Ladders were also made, but it
became unnecessary to use them; for Saintloo&#8217;s men advanced
along the frail and shifting path and carried the castle with
a rush. The garrison ran out at the other side, and the
bridge was then broken down with such tools as were at
hand. The army then returned to Limerick, and Lord
Butler went to Carrick-on-Suir for more cannon before undertaking
the recovery of Carrigogunnell, which the Irish
had again seized by stratagem.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

throughout this expedition assumed the character of a Royal
Commissioner, to which he had not a shadow of title. He
associated with the loosest of boon companions, who disturbed
the camp by night and day and swore, with the truth born of
alcohol, that he was no Commissioner. At O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s Bridge
he blamed Grey for not providing sapping tools, which must
have tired out the soldiers, and which would have been quite
useless. He was very indignant at having to sleep on the
ground &#8216;from Friday inclusive until Tuesday exclusive,&#8217; but
no one else was better off. Grey, a thorough soldier, was at
no pains to conceal his contempt:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;I desired him to be contented, for I had seen better men
than he was, or should be, or any that was there, lodged worse.
He was displeased therewith, desiring me not to judge what
his fortune might be. Then I said, I was sure he should never
be so good as the Duke of Norfolk, and Suffolk, and my lord my
brother (the Marquis of Dorset), whom I had seen lodged worse.
Whereat he took a great fume for that I should judge any impossibility
what he might be; and thereupon leaving us at our
coming to Limerick, departed towards Dublin in a great anger.
But of his gests by the way the folly of it is such, I will not
commit to writing, but, I assure you, like no Commissioner.&#8217;</p>

<p>This short experience of Irish campaigning was enough for
Body, who returned to Dublin and busied himself in undermining
Grey&#8217;s influence. Few seem to have had his good
word, except Ossory and his son, who took care to be civil to
Cromwell&#8217;s confidential man. But Body was perhaps a better
judge of a country than of a general&#8217;s qualifications. &#8216;As
far as I have seen it,&#8217; he wrote, &#8216;that is to say the counties
of Dublin, Kildare, Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Ormond,
Ossory, Desmond, Limerick, and Thomond, if there be any
paradise in this world, it may be accounted for one among
them, both for beauty and goodness.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The army which Grey had at Limerick did not much
exceed 2,000 men, including the Butlers and their not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
trustworthy Irish allies. The Pale had been much exhausted
by the Kildare rebellion, and it was purposely spared, much
to the indignation of Body, who, like many other casual
visitors, fancied he understood Ireland better than men who
had studied it for years. The Lord Deputy had only 700
men of his own and had no money to pay them. Saintloo&#8217;s
company had received some part of their money at Waterford,
but broke out again soon after leaving that city; and it was
supposed that two subalterns, Gerbert and Powell, were the
true ringleaders. Grey&#8217;s gunners stood firm, and by threatening
to use the guns he kept the mutineers quiet for a time.
They behaved, as we have seen, with great gallantry at
O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s Bridge; but they refused to go beyond the Shannon,
and the idea of a pursuit into Clare was therefore given
up. The Council thought Grey&#8217;s person in danger, and he
owned to more peril from his soldiers than from the Irish
enemy. He could depend only on his own immediate followers,
100 horse and as many foot, and upon one officer,
that Stephen Parry whom we have met before. Whenever
the bulk of the troops were called upon to perform a service
they all answered together, &#8216;Let us have money, and we will
do it.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Butlers

<p>The troops being pacified for the moment and Lord Butler
having arrived with another battering piece, the garrison of
Carrigogunnell, consisting partly of Desmond men and partly
of O&#8217;Briens, were summoned to surrender on promise of their
lives, and warned that if the castle had to be taken by force
no quarter should be shown to man, woman, or child. They
detained the messenger and returned no answer. A breach
was soon made, and, after more than one failure and the loss
of thirty men killed and wounded, the castle was taken by
storm. Seventeen of the defenders were killed in the fight,
and of forty-six survivors all were put to death on the spot,
except certain gentlemen of the O&#8217;Briens, for whom large
ransoms were refused, and who were taken to Limerick, tried
for high treason, and immediately executed. Chief Justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Aylmer accompanied the army for such purposes. The castle
was handed over to Lord Butler, who placed it in his brother-in-law&#8217;s
charge, and Donogh, having gained his great object,
became a scourge to the citizens of Limerick.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grey

<p>The troops positively refused to go into Clare without
receiving their arrears, and Grey had nothing to give. He
therefore proposed to leave them at Limerick, Cork, and Kilmallock;
giving his own and the Council&#8217;s security for their
victualling until the King should think proper to send money.
They refused; and Butler&#8217;s men, after twenty days&#8217; trial of
Lough Gur, would stay there no longer unless the towns had
English garrisons. James Fitz-Maurice, whom the King acknowledged
as Earl of Desmond, and who had a party in the
country, was not at hand, and as no one could take his place
the castle was abandoned. The artillery was left at Limerick
and Clonmel, and the Lord Deputy went back to meet Parliament
at Dublin. His expedition had shown that a small army
well led and well paid could go anywhere and do anything
in Ireland, and that feudal castles could do nothing against a
proper siege train; but it had also shown that the necessary
conditions were not likely to be fulfilled under a King who
gave away priories while crossing passages, and who staked
one of the finest peals of bells in London upon a single throw
of the dice.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>The death of the Duke of Richmond, whom his father no
doubt intended to advance and whom Charles V. even thought,
or professed to think, destined to succeed him, made no
difference to the country which he nominally governed. It
was indeed at first supposed that Acts of Parliament passed

<p>The actual revenue of Ireland, derived partly from forfeitures
and partly from a parliamentary grant, amounted at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
this time to about 5,000<i>l.</i>, of which 1,000<i>l.</i> was not paid.
Henry, who was of course obliged to supplement this, complained
that he got very little for his money, and wished to
reduce the Irish establishment. He declared that he valued
an increase of income less for himself than for the common
good of Ireland. &#8216;A great sort of you,&#8217; he wrote to the Lord
Deputy and Council (we must be plain), &#8216;desire nothing else
but to reign in estimation and to fleece from time to time all
that you may catch from us.&#8217; He announced therefore that
he was about to send an independent person with ample
powers to inquire into Irish affairs. He gave Brabazon detailed
instructions for a survey of marsh lands, and bade
him go to war no more but apply himself wholly to financial
affairs. No salary was to be paid to any officer who acted by
deputy, and none but customary fees exacted. Henry said he
was determined to reform Ireland, and would value his servants
there according to their merits in that behalf. &#8216;If anyone,&#8217;
he wrote, &#8216;directly or indirectly devised and practised
the let, hindrance, or impeachment of this our purpose for
any respect, whereunto we will not fail to have a special eye,

<p>To this formidable letter Grey and his Council answered
that the army had never been properly paid, and had in consequence
often mutinied, that they had spent every farthing
of revenue on public objects, and had raised large additional
sums on their own credit, that credit was now quite exhausted,
and that without money to pay off the men it was impossible
further to reduce the military establishment. Brabazon had
accounted or was ready to account for every penny, &#8216;and as
to our desire to reign in estimation, it is to be thought that
among civil people there can no name of dignity or honour be
in estimation, unless thereunto be annexed rule and riches.

<div class="sidenote">Grey attacks
the
O&#8217;Connors,
1537.</div>

<p>Those best acquainted with the country at this time believed
that the necessary precedent to its reduction was a
thorough conquest of Leinster. The overthrow of the Kildare
Geraldines was necessary, but had its inconveniences.
They had been a standing menace to the Government, but
they had kept the Irish at bay, and their fall left the marches
quite open. Without security either of life or title no one
would work the forfeited lands, and the margin of waste
grew broader every day. Grey&#8217;s temper and talents made
him prefer war to diplomacy, and he resolved to strike at
O&#8217;Connor, whose hostages were in his hands, and who was
under recognizance to deliver 800 cows to the King, but
who had regained complete possession of Offaly. His brother
Cahir had suffered the not uncommon fate of those who support
Irish governments, and had been an exile for two years.
Grey, Brabazon, and Aylmer took fourteen days&#8217; provisions
from Dublin, and were joined on the march by Lords Delvin,
Slane, and Killeen, and by William Saintloo, now seneschal
of Wexford, with his own company and 100 kerne. They
passed along the southern edge of Westmeath to MacGeohegan&#8217;s
country, the modern barony of Moycashel, and took
hostages from that chief and from O&#8217;Molloy, whose district
lay further south. On the same day Brabazon got possession
of Brackland Castle through the treachery of an inmate, who
acted in Cahir O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s interest, and who was pardoned
while the rest of the garrison were beheaded. The soldiers
destroyed all that lay in their path, and on the fifth day
arrived before Dangan, afterwards Philipstown, which had
been fortified with some skill. The march was only of five
or six miles, but the ground was boggy, and a road had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
be made with fascines and hurdles. The ditches about the
castle were filled in the same way, and the courtyard was
forced before nightfall. Three days were spent in waiting
for one large and two small pieces of artillery, and on the
bright May morning following their arrival fire was opened
upon the keep. After four hours&#8217; cannonade, resulting as
usual in those days with the disabling of the principal gun,
a breach was made and the castle at once stormed. The
walls were dismantled, and the heads of their twenty-three
defenders set on poles &#8216;for a show to the O&#8217;Connors.&#8217; On
the next day Ossory&#8217;s second son Richard, afterwards created
Viscount Mountgarret, came to excuse his father, who had
been kept away by ill-health. O&#8217;Connor in the meantime
had fled into O&#8217;Carroll&#8217;s country, &#8216;which O&#8217;Carroll,&#8217; Grey
carefully notes, &#8216;is the Earl of Ossory&#8217;s friend.&#8217; The punishment
of O&#8217;Carroll for harbouring the fugitive was nevertheless
entrusted to Richard Butler, partly to punish his
tardiness, and partly because Grey&#8217;s fifteen days&#8217; provisions
were almost gone. It was an absurd expedient, and before
the end of the year O&#8217;Connor was back and Cahir had fled
the country. The sole result of the expedition was to show
the force of artillery; yet Henry, unless his language be
thought ironical, calls it a notable exploit. &#8216;If, however,&#8217;
the King added, &#8216;he should be suffered to enter again, it
should but add a further courage to that traitorous malice
which by all likelihood is so entered, that it will not be removed.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grey makes
many
enemies.</div>

<p>Grey had many enemies, for he was not conciliatory, and
his relationship to the Geraldines laid him open to the suspicions
of all who had risen on the ruins of the House of
Kildare. With Brabazon, the ablest man about him, he had
long been on cold terms, and many supposed that the Vice-Treasurer
thought he ought to have been Deputy himself.
Thomas Agard, Vice-Treasurer of the Mint, a sour but apparently
honest Puritan, hated Grey for his attachment to old
religious forms, and Archbishop Browne lost no opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of attacking him on the same grounds. Alen, Master of the
Rolls, a useful public servant, but with an inborn love of
intrigue, gave trouble to every successive chief governor.
Robert Cowley and his son were devoted to the House of
Ormonde, which Grey thought too powerful. The Deputy
did not favour the innovations in religion, and took no pains
to hide his dislike to Browne and Agard; but with the rest
he was always ready to co-operate. The King, however,
found it hard to reconcile conflicting accounts, and resolved
to send over Commissioners unconnected with Irish factions
to report upon the actual state of affairs. The persons
selected were Anthony St. Leger, of Ulcombe in Kent, one
of the wisest statesmen who ever represented the English
Crown in Ireland; George Paulet, a younger brother of the
astute courtier who is best known as Marquis of Winchester,
but not equally endowed with prudence; Thomas Moyle, of
Gray&#8217;s Inn, Receiver-General of the Court of Augmentations,
and afterwards Speaker of the English House of Commons;
and William Berners, auditor of the same court. The Irish
Government was directed to treat them with as much deference
as if the King were present; and they were ordered to
treat Grey with much consideration, and to take his advice
when possible. The latter instruction, so well calculated to
soothe the Lord Deputy&#8217;s wounded pride, was not directly
made known to him. The Commissioners were ordered to
present their credentials to the Lord Deputy as soon as they
reached Dublin, and then to summon the Council and read
the King&#8217;s letter, in which he promised to remember their good
services. &#8216;If, on the other side,&#8217; he added, &#8216;we shall not find
you now faithful officers, ministers, and good councillors, but
men given more to your own affectes, commodities, and gains,
than earnestly bent to our satisfaction, we shall again so look
upon the best of you so misusing himself for it, as shall be
little cause to rejoice at length of his doings in that behalf.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The King
sends a

Commission.</div>

<p>The first duty imposed on the Commissioners was the
reduction of expenditure and the increase of revenue. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
cheap defence to the Pale, hostages were to be generally taken,
and the army was, if possible, to be cut down to 340 picked
men, inclusive of garrisons. Horsemen were to receive
8<i>l.</i> yearly, footmen 4<i>l.</i>, constables of castles 13<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,
gate-keepers 6<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, under-warders 4<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&mdash;all in
Irish currency, or about two-thirds of the sterling amounts.
The Vice-Treasurer was in future to visit all garrisons
quarterly, to see that deserving men received commands, and
to provide for frequent musters of all borne on the books. All
soldiers in excess of the new establishment were to be paid
off with money specially provided, and the King, with a
touch of his daughter&#8217;s temper, gave orders that they should
be induced if possible to take less than their due. The Commissioners
were to survey waste lands and were authorised to
give leases for twenty-one years, with a clause of forfeiture
for non-observance of the laws as to English dress and for
alliance with Irish rebels&mdash;the penalties provided by law
being also enforced. After this all offices and officers were
to be subjected to rigid scrutiny, with a view to increased
efficiency and reduced expense. Detailed instructions were
given as to public accounts, and Brabazon was to be repaid
all he had spent in annoying the King&#8217;s rebels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Powers of
this Commission.</div>

<p>The control of legislation was also given to the Commissioners,
who were to see various Acts for the establishment
of royal authority in Church and State duly passed.
They were to inquire as to the claims of clerical proctors to
interfere in Parliament, were themselves to have a right of
entry as the King&#8217;s councillors, and were to expound the
royal policy &#8216;with all their wit and dexterity, and with such
stomach, where they shall perceive any man frowardly, perversely
bent to the let and impeachment of the King&#8217;s purpose
in the same, as they may the rather by their wisdom
both conduce the thing to effect and reconcile the parties
that before would show themselves so wilful and obstinate.&#8217;
Messages to this effect were sent to both Houses, both Wolsey
and Cromwell relying upon a species of intimidation of which
Charles I.&#8217;s attempt on the five members is the last recorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
example. The Commissioners afterwards exercised the power
of dissolving Parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The King

<p>The Commissioners were to examine charges of taking
money from the rebels which were brought against many
men highly placed in Ireland; Henry rightly supposing that
many nominal subjects connived at treason, as in the case of
O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s Bridge, which had cost much to take and to demolish,
and which was now as strong and as troublesome as ever. But
he did not choose to see that want of money was the chief
cause of this failure. He was indeed, he said, determined to
make a full reformation some day, and the information now
collected would be very useful when the convenient season
arrived. In the meantime, the Commissioners were to reduce
the garrison to 340 men.</p>

Grey&#8217;s
activity
against the
Irish.</div>

<p>St. Leger and his companions set out early in August,
but were detained by adverse winds about Holyhead, and did
not arrive at Dublin till the middle of September. Grey had
unusually strong reasons for exertions, and he begged hard
for money and artillery. The pay of the army was twelve
months in arrear. O&#8217;Connor was coshering among his friends
&#8216;more liker a beggar, than he that ever was a captain or ruler
of a country,&#8217; and making vain suits daily to the Government.
But Grey had not caught him, and he could be submissive
enough until what was left of his corn had been saved; his
neighbours, English and Irish, thinking it more prudent to
shelter an enterprising rebel than to run risks for a Government
which could not protect its friends. Grey, who habitually
used strong language, characterises these prudent people as
&#8216;having as much falsehood remaining in them as all the devils
of hell.&#8217; Having, as he supposed, made O&#8217;Connor &#8216;as low as
a dog were for the bone,&#8217; he applied himself to the Kavanaghs,
whose chief, Cahir MacArt, had married a Geraldine. It had
been often proposed to extirpate them and to colonise the
country. The Lord Deputy now entered Carlow, burned
some castles of the O&#8217;Nolans between Newtownbarry and
Tullow, forced Cahir MacArt to give hostages, and then
turned sharply upon Ely O&#8217;Carroll, where O&#8217;Connor had first
found a refuge. He had now the help of Ossory, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
always glad to weaken a neighbour, and of Cahir O&#8217;Connor,
who was as anxious as his brother to divert attention from
the Offaly corn. He passed unopposed through the lands of
the Fitzpatricks, O&#8217;Mores, O&#8217;Molloys, and MacGeohegans,
received O&#8217;Carroll&#8217;s submission, and then entered Tipperary,
where he took a castle belonging to O&#8217;Meagher, the chief of
Ikerrin. O&#8217;Connor came in on safe-conduct, and paid 300
marks for his son, who was given up to him. Grey refused
to trust him, and begged Cromwell never to allow his restoration;
and the event proved Grey right, though he soon
forgot his own advice. He now announced to the minister
that he was beginning to understand the Irish nature, and
that the King needed only to be in earnest. He was right
in blaming constant changes of policy, but like most soldiers
he failed to see the real difficulties of the Irish problem.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

Death of
Hugh Oge,
1537.</div>

<p>It was now just a quarter of a century since Hugh Oge
O&#8217;Donnell, then on his return from Rome, had been received
with honour at the Court of Henry VIII. Deeply impressed
by what he saw there, and aware of the impossibility of
uniting all Irish tribes against the stranger, he had always
striven to keep English intruders at bay by remaining on
good terms with the Government, and had exerted his strength
only to subdue his neighbours on the side furthest removed
from the Pale. He had thus extended his sway over the
modern counties of Roscommon and Sligo, and over great
portions of Fermanagh, Mayo, and Galway, and even of
Down and Antrim. He had forced or persuaded the O&#8217;Neills
to acknowledge his claims to the disputed sovereignty
over Innishowen, Raphoe, and Fermanagh; and the Irish
generally were so much impressed by his wisdom and prowess
that they supposed him to be Hugh the Valiant, the promised
Celtic Messiah, who was to redress or avenge the wrongs of
Erin. When it seemed clear that this was not so, the
dreamers of dreams declared that as he had failed the deliverer
would never come. His panegyrists reckon among his titles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
to fame that &#8216;the seasons were favourable, so that sea and
land were productive:&#8217; it is more to the purpose that he
executed strict justice and repressed thieves. Like most
Irish chiefs, he had difficulties with his children, and his
valiant son Manus was discarded at the instance of a mistress
whom the old chief had brought into his house. For this
and for other sins he made such reparation as he could by a
late repentance, donned the cord and cowl of St. Francis,
and died in the odour of sanctity. He was buried in his
religious dress in the monastery which his father had built at
Donegal for friars of the strict observance; and Manus was at
once acknowledged both by the tribesmen and by O&#8217;Neill, and
was inaugurated at Kilmacrenan with the usual ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Disturbances
in
the North.</div>

<p>The new chief at once took up the thread of his father&#8217;s
policy by invading Connaught, and at the same time making
loyal professions to Grey. He had, he wrote, been tempted
to rebellion by all the disaffected lords in the South and West,
but was determined to take no advice but that of the King
and his Deputy. As soon as he heard of Hugh O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s
death, Grey at once repaired to the borders of Ulster. The
galleys of O&#8217;Neill and his Scotch allies had threatened a
fortified settlement at Ardglass on the coast of Down, and the
Deputy burned to invade Tyrone; but the Council dissuaded
him, and the receipt of Manus O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s letter gave hopes
of settling the North by peaceful means. Some thought
Grey too fond of making aimless raids, and Alen made some
sensible remarks on the subject. &#8216;I would not,&#8217; he wrote to
St. Leger, &#8216;have the Deputy representing the King&#8217;s Majesty&#8217;s
person and estate be a common skurrer for every light matter;
but, when he should begin a war, begin it upon a just good
ground, and when it were so begun, to be so profoundly executed,

baffled by
the
O&#8217;Connors.</div>

<p>Grey had been sanguine enough to believe that his work
in Offaly would be lasting, but, as Henry had partly foreseen,
O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s return had undone it all. Cahir was a fugitive,
and the floods protected Offaly, where the corn had been safely
garnered in. At last the waters subsided, and Grey reached
Brackland by the old road through Westmeath. O&#8217;Connor
escaped into O&#8217;Doyne&#8217;s country, the modern barony of Tinnahinch,
which Grey and Richard Butler proceeded to ravage.
While thus employed the scattered troops were surprised by
O&#8217;Connor, and some were killed. The Lord Deputy was just
able to destroy or carry away the corn stored at Geashill, and
to return to Dublin without having seen the enemy. To gain
time till the season of long days came round again, Grey gave
a safe-conduct to O&#8217;Connor, who proposed to visit Dublin.
&#8216;But shortly herein to conclude,&#8217; as Brabazon puts it, &#8216;the
said traitor and his brother Cahir fell to agreement and concord,
so that at this presents they both remain in Offaly.&#8217;
St. Leger, who had a cooler temper than Grey, saw the
impossibility of subduing even a single clan by desultory
hostings. &#8216;The country,&#8217; he said, &#8216;is much easier won than
kept.&#8217; To overrun Offaly was a small thing, but it could
only be united to the Pale by the costly expedient of fixed
garrisons. O&#8217;Connor had got back his son, and indeed neither
he nor any Irishman had much regard for promises or for the
fate of hostages.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">He continues
to
attack
them.</div>

<p>The O&#8217;Connors were weakened by repeated blows, and
Alderman Herbert, who had long advised a colonising policy,
proposed that Offaly should be peopled with Englishmen
once for all. Grey again invaded the doomed district with
800 men, and O&#8217;Connor at once declared himself willing to
treat, though he utterly refused to trust himself within the
Pale. Grey halted at Kinnafad, where a castle built by the
Berminghams still overhangs the ford of the Boyne. Having
taken precautions against treachery, the Lord Deputy passed
about half his men over the river, and then advanced with
twelve horsemen to an open field about a quarter of a mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
off, where O&#8217;Connor met him similarly attended. The chief
submitted to the King&#8217;s clemency, begged Grey&#8217;s intercession,
and promised to come to Dublin in three days. Cahir
sent word that he would come too, but broke his promise.
O&#8217;Connor kept his tryst, acknowledged himself the King&#8217;s
liegeman, abjured the authority of the Pope for himself and
his tribesmen, renounced all Irish exactions, and gave up his
black-rents, including a pension of sixty marks from the King.
Thanks were in future to be his only reward for service;
and he offered to hold legally of the King &#8216;that portion of
lands in Offaly which he held by partition after his country&#8217;s
fashion,&#8217; undertaking that his brothers and other holders of
land there should become entitled in the same way. These
lands were to be subject to impositions at so much per ploughland,
as if they were situated in the Pale, assessments for the
defence of the King&#8217;s subjects being made as occasion might
arise at the Lord Deputy&#8217;s discretion. For himself he solicited
the honour of Baron of Offaly, and begged for such protection
as the Government habitually gave to Englishmen. He agreed
that the Lord Deputy and all the marchers might cut passes
where they pleased, and gave up his son again pending the
King&#8217;s final decision. The crafty Cahir was hunted down,
apparently with his brother&#8217;s help, and brought to Dublin,
where he agreed to similar terms and also gave up his son.
Yet many sceptics thought the O&#8217;Connors would slip the
yoke at the first opportunity, and it is evident that nothing
had occurred to change their nature, or to attach them to
English habits or to English government.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Seizure of
the five
Geraldines.</div>

<p>A main object of Grey&#8217;s attack both on the O&#8217;Connors and
the O&#8217;Briens may have been to get possession of the heir
of Kildare, whose half-sister was married to the chief
of Offaly. It is difficult to avoid the thought that Grey had
a private as well as a public object in persecuting to the
death all members of the fallen family except the children of
his own sister. The rebel Earl had five uncles, all men of
fair ability and great influence, and Brabazon seems first to
have suggested that they ought to be kept in England.
Grey asked Sir James Fitzgerald and his brothers Walter and
Richard, all of whom had opposed the rebellion, to dine with
him at Kilmainham, and in the middle of dinner they were
all seized and handcuffed. Sir John and Oliver were arrested
before they had heard of their brothers&#8217; capture, and the five
were lodged in the castle. Grey always plumed himself on
this exploit, though he admitted that some of the prisoners
were innocent. The Irish Council approved the deed and
applauded its secret handling, but none of the Irish officials
knew that they were sending these men to the scaffold; the
guilt of that must rest on Henry and Cromwell. Aylmer and
Alen accompanied them to England, and the chronicler tells
us that Richard, who had literary tastes, relieved the tedium
of a sea-voyage by singing songs and repeating apophthegms.
When he heard that the ship was called &#8216;The Cow,&#8217; he was
much dismayed, for there was a prophecy that five Earls&#8217;
brethren should be carried to England in a cow&#8217;s belly, and
should never return. &#8216;Whereat,&#8217; says Stanihurst, &#8216;the rest
began afresh to howl and lament, which doubtless was pitiful,
to behold five valiant gentlemen, that durst meet in the field
as sturdy champions as could be picked out in a realm, to be
so suddenly terrified with the bare name of a wooden cow, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
to fear like lions a silly coxcomb, being moved (as commonly
the whole country is) with a vain and fabulous old wives&#8217;
dream.&#8217; On reaching London they were at once sent to the
Tower, and left it only to take the last sad journey to
Tyburn.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Survivor of
the Kildare
family.
The &#8216;Fair
Geraldine.&#8217;</div>

<p>But the family was not destined to extinction. Lady
Kildare had accompanied her husband to England, and had
her three daughters with her. The eldest was deaf and
dumb, and of the youngest nothing particular is recorded, but
the second, Lady Elizabeth, has by a strange chance been immortalised
as the &#8216;Fair Geraldine.&#8217; While yet a child she
became maid of honour to the Princess Mary, at whose house
at Hunsdon Henry, Earl of Surrey, saw her. She was then
only twelve. Four years later she was married to Sir
Anthony Browne, Master of the Horse and Knight of the
Garter, but also a widower of sixty, whose daughter by his
first marriage became her brother Gerald&#8217;s wife. The unequal
match was solemnized in the presence of the King and
of the Lady Mary, and Ridley preached on the occasion which
drew forth Surrey&#8217;s sonnet. The situation of the bride&#8217;s
family and the apparent sacrifice of herself sufficiently account
for the poetry, and there is no reason to suppose that the
poet, who was married, had any regrets for himself. The
study of Italian models would naturally lead to rather high-flown
language, and poets were always privileged. The romantic
fable of the magic mirror in which Cornelius Agrippa,
an alchemist living at Florence, showed him the fair one reclining
on a bridal couch and reading his sonnet, would not
be worth noticing but that it found its way into the &#8216;Lay of
the Last Minstrel.&#8217; It is refuted by the fact that Surrey
never was in Italy. After the death of Browne, who outlived
Surrey, Lady Elizabeth was married to the Lord Admiral
Clinton, who had been twice a widower. She left no children
by either marriage, but her influence at Court may have had
much to do with her brother&#8217;s restoration. A portrait remains
to show that she had a sweet face, and that she was not fairer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
than many who have had no poet. But canvas, and especially the
canvas of Holbein&#8217;s school, seldom preserves the charm of grace
and motion. Three letters remain, creditable so far as they
go, and written in a clear, bold hand which contrasts strikingly
with the crabbed characters often affected by public men,
characters which drew a sarcasm from Shakespeare, and still
trouble the historian. A portrait, three letters, and fourteen
pretty lines would have hardly preserved the fair Geraldine&#8217;s
memory had it not been for the tragic fates of her father, her
brother, and her poet.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward
Fitzgerald.</div>

<p>Less than two years after her husband&#8217;s death, and while
her rash stepson was lying in the Tower, Lady Kildare came
to live at her brother Leonard&#8217;s house at Beaumanoir in
Leicestershire. She found there her son Edward, aged eight,
who had been brought by some devoted but unknown friends
&#8216;without word, token, nor letter.&#8217; With touching humbleness
she begged to be allowed the custody of him &#8216;because he is
an innocent, to see him brought up in virtue.&#8217; The prayer
was granted, and the child thus strangely rescued lived to
be Lieutenant of Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s pensioners, and ancestor
of the Dukes of Leinster.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Gerald
Fitzgerald.</div>

<p>The King was most anxious to get Lady Kildare&#8217;s eldest
son into his power, and St. Leger avers that the King had no
object &#8216;but to cherish him as his kinsman in like sort as his
other brother is cherished with his mother in the realm of
England.&#8217; Having disposed of all who were old enough to
be dangerous, it was doubtless Henry&#8217;s intention to bring up
the children in English ways and in dependence on him.
But Lady Mary O&#8217;Connor had other views, and the adventures
of Gerald show how inextricably the Geraldines were intermingled
with Celtic families. He was ten years old when his
half-brother was taken, and was then lying in small-pox at
Donore in Kildare. As soon as he could be moved his tutor,
Thomas Leverous, who was his father&#8217;s foster-brother, carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
him off in a basket and brought him safely to his sister in
Offaly. Lady Mary procured him a three months&#8217; shelter
among the O&#8217;Doynes, and he was then removed to Clare and
placed under the charge of James Delahide. O&#8217;Brien, who
had the Kildare plate and jewels as well as the heir in his
power, refused all offers of the Government; and Leverous and
Delahide were allowed to take Gerald to Kilbrittain Castle,
and give him up to his aunt, Lady Eleanor MacCarthy, widow
of the late and mother of the actual chief of Carbery. Had
James Fitzjohn of Desmond wished to surrender the boy
MacCarthy could hardly have resisted; but they agreed to
amuse the Government with evasive answers, while Gerald
employed himself in visiting the old tenants of his family
about Adare and Croom. James Fitzjohn offered to take
those manors on lease, the real object being to keep off grants
to strangers. But Lady Eleanor feared the issue of this unequal
contest, and agreed to marry Manus O&#8217;Donnell, whom
she had rejected some years before. The marriage was desired
by the whole Geraldine connection, and Lady Eleanor, accompanied
by Leverous, Delahide, and the chaplain Walshe, brought
her nephew safely through Thomond, Clanricarde, and Mayo,
into Tyrconnell. All the O&#8217;Briens and Burkes welcomed and
sped them on their journey. As the travellers approached
Sligo they were joined by a rhymer named M&#8217;Cragh, a native
of Tipperary, who was studying his craft in those parts, and
through him many details became known to Ormonde. After
her marriage with O&#8217;Donnell, Lady Eleanor busied herself in
forming a confederacy of the Northern chiefs with Desmond
and her friends in Leinster and Munster.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Gerald
escapes to
France,
1540.</div>

<p>But Irish plots are commonly woven in sand, and Grey&#8217;s
activity disconcerted her schemes. Fearing that O&#8217;Donnell
might be bribed, as Brabazon suggested, to give up the boy,
she determined to send him to France. Allen Governor, an
English shipowner of St. Malo, happened to be trading in
Donegal, and agreed to take the precious passenger. A contract
was drawn up before a notary, in which Governor bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
himself to land Gerald and his companions safely in France.
Bareheaded, and wearing only the saffron shirt of a humble
native, Gerald stole out in a small boat by night and committed
himself and his fortunes to the chances of the sea.
His aunt had provided him with 140 moidores, and he had
also some plate, with part of which his passage was paid.
His companions were Leverous, Robert Walshe, a faithful
ally but a stern disciplinarian, who did not even spare the rod
in the interests of his noble charge, and a young gentleman
whose name is not recorded. They arrived safely at Morlaix,
where the military governor received Gerald and led him
through the town by the hand, taking especial care that no
English trader should come near him. Henry&#8217;s ambassador
was nevertheless well informed as to the boy&#8217;s movements.
He re-embarked on the same vessel with a pilot named Jacques
Cartier, who brought him to St. Malo, where he was hospitably
treated by the Lieutenant-Governor.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Gerald
abroad,
1540.</div>

<p>When Chateaubriand, the Governor of Brittany, heard
the news, he sent a special messenger to bring the refugees to
Rennes. The gossips there would have it that Gerald was
the rightful King of Ireland, and that Henry was a mere
usurper; and neither he nor his friends could correct them:
for they spoke no French. Chateaubriand treated his guest
well and forwarded him to Court, where Wallop demanded
his surrender as a treaty obligation. Francis did not deny
this, but quietly removed the boy to the imperial town of
Valenciennes. The faithful Leverous still attended him to
watch against English kidnappers who were hanging about,
and for greater security sent him to the Emperor at Brussels.
But English diplomacy was importunate, and Charles transferred
him to the Prince-bishop of Liège, with an allowance
of one hundred crowns a month. After six months&#8217; residence
with the Bishop, his kinsman Reginald Pole sent him to Italy,
pensioned him, and provided the best education the peninsula
afforded in the houses of the Bishops of Verona and Mantua,
and of Gonzago, Duke of Milan, who gave him a further
pension. His last patron in Italy was Cosmo de&#8217; Medici, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
allowed him three hundred crowns annually; and a three
years&#8217; residence at Florence doubtless made him a proficient
in the arts of courtly dissimulation. Leverous was admitted to
the English monastery at Rome, and in Mary&#8217;s reign became
Bishop of Kildare; Robert Walshe went back to Ireland, but
I do not find that his attainder was reversed or that he was
ever pardoned.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Geraldine
pride.</div>

<p>O&#8217;Donnell soon made his submission, and was restored to
favour. Lady Eleanor had some reason to be afraid, for Alen
had proposed to invade Tyrconnell by sea and land with all
the forces at the King&#8217;s disposal. But she had now secured
her nephew, and cared nothing for her new husband or his
dangers. She called him traitor and many other hard names,
said that the only object of her marriage was now gained,
and that she had no further occasion for his company. She
returned to her son&#8217;s relations in Munster, but was not pardoned
till 1545, seemingly because she did not ask sooner.
The Irish Government refused to plead her cause as long as
she remained obstinately among the MacCarthies. She came
therefore to Malahide on safe-conduct, and thence forwarded
a petition to which, as if the Geraldine pride scorned the
Irish strain, she affixed her maiden name. After this the
frequent reports of a Geraldine invasion ceased, but the head
of the family thought it prudent to remain abroad until the
death of Henry VIII.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">END OF GREY&#8217;S ADMINISTRATION.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Ormonde
proposes to
reform his
country.</div>

<p>The O&#8217;Connors having been quieted for the moment, Ormonde,
who had private as well as public reasons for his advice, proposed
a temporising policy towards O&#8217;Neill and O&#8217;Reilly on
the north, and towards O&#8217;Byrne and O&#8217;Toole on the south,
side of the Pale. The Government might then easily subdue
the Kavanaghs, who were surrounded by settled districts.
Their chief, Cahir MacEncross, who has been called the last
King of Leinster, had till lately been Constable, and his acceptance
of the office seems to have been thought a condescension.
Ormonde&#8217;s son Richard had now succeeded him, and
with the aid of Saintloo and his Wexford men might hope to
reduce the whole country. To strengthen Kilkenny against a
possible counter attack from the O&#8217;Mores, Ormonde secured the
services of Edmond MacSwiney, a powerful hereditary chief of
gallowglasses, whom O&#8217;Connor had brought from Donegal.
The Earl thought it cheaper to outbid O&#8217;Connor than to have
MacSwiney&#8217;s band thrown into the scale of rebellion. Desmond
and the rest excused their slowness to reform by saying
that they waited for him to begin; and he was anxious to
wipe out this reproach, regretting only that he had not the
same powers in Kilkenny as in Tipperary. Though not disinterested,
Ormonde&#8217;s was probably the best available plan,
and his reforming zeal was certainly serious. &#8216;I have proclaimed,&#8217;
he said, &#8216;over all the county of Tipperary, that no
caines, allyiegs, errikes, Irish Brehons, neither that law,
rahowns, and many like exactions and extortions shall cease,
with reformation for the grey merchants, and the Liberty
court to be duly continued, as the King&#8217;s laws require.&#8217; In
Kilkenny he could only exhort; &#8216;howbeit,&#8217; he added, &#8216;I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
often persuaded many of them to be converted, which to do
I can scarcely have their assents, for the lust they have to
caines and other abuses, turning to their profit, as it doth to
mine.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grey goes
to Ulster,
1538.</div>

<p>Taking advantage of O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s quiescent state, Grey cut
passes on the borders of Offaly wide enough for several carts
abreast. He then turned his eyes to the North, where the
MacMahons of Ferney had for three years neglected to pay
their tribute of 10<i>l.</i> The borderers of English race were opposed
to Grey&#8217;s raid, and gave the MacMahons warning, but
he managed to capture 500 cows, and as many pigs and goats.
The expedition was as useless as it was inglorious, for Louth
was invaded within a week, and O&#8217;Neill, who complained
that his black-rent was unpaid, plundered the borders of the
Pale and threatened to burn Drogheda. The men of that
town and of Dundalk and Ardee rallied at the Lord Deputy&#8217;s
summons, and O&#8217;Neill then became quieter in his behaviour.
But nothing could keep Grey quiet. He lent soldiers to one
Chamberlayne of Athboy, to revenge a private quarrel against
O&#8217;Reilly. That chief had hitherto been at peace with the
Pale; but he lost his brother in this aimless brawl, and a
general alliance of the Northern chiefs was with difficulty
averted. The MacMahons had done far more harm to Louth
than Grey had done to them, and he could gain little reputation
by enterprises which had no apparent object but
plunder.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
O&#8217;Tooles.</div>

<p>While the Lord Deputy was driving cattle in Ulster, the
other side of the Pale was in a blaze. John Kelway, Constable
of Rathmore, saw some servants of Tirlogh O&#8217;Toole
eating meat, assumed that it was stolen, and incontinently
hanged them. This seems to have been thought unusual
even among borderers, and Kelway&#8217;s conduct found no defen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>ders.
But the O&#8217;Tooles were willing to consider the question
of compensation in Irish fashion, and a meeting took
place for the purpose. Kelway brought a considerable force,
and, on the parley being dissolved without an agreement,
he followed the Irish into their mountains. The mountaineers
turned to bay on advantageous ground, and drove the
English into a small tower. Its thatched roof burned readily,
and the whole party had to surrender. The O&#8217;Tooles killed
Kelway, who deserved nothing better, but held the gentlemen
of the Pale to ransom. Chief Justice Aylmer&#8217;s son was
present but escaped, while his brother, Richard Aylmer of
Lyons, was taken prisoner. About sixty of the marchers, all
householders, fell in this wretched business, and so great a
panic followed that an Irishman in Judge Luttrell&#8217;s service
was afraid to travel from Glendalough to Dublin. It is ever
thus between races of different degrees of civilisation; if the
backward people are beaten it is thought quite natural, but
the slightest check is of importance when experienced by
members of the higher organisation.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grey falls
out with the
Butlers.</div>

<p>The Lord Deputy and the Butlers had never been very
good friends, and the dissension now reached such a height
as to disturb the whole country. &#8216;I was never,&#8217; exclaimed
Brabazon, &#8216;in despair in Ireland until now,&#8217; and others were
not more hopeful. &#8216;My Lord Deputy,&#8217; said Lord Butler, &#8216;is
the Earl of Kildare born again?&#8217; and Luttrell, a keen observer,
thought Ormonde hated Grey worse than he had hated Kildare.
The Butlers complained that the Lord Deputy systematically
slighted their party and favoured the Geraldines; he retorted
that they intrigued with Irishmen against his government.
One or two of the matters in dispute call for more
particular notice.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ormonde
and the
O&#8217;Carrolls.</div>

<p>After many struggles Fergananim O&#8217;Carroll was the acknowledged
chief of Ely. His wife was daughter to Kildare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
and sister-in-law to O&#8217;Connor, and he was ready to submit
to Grey as the best means of opposing Ormonde. He promised
to hold his land of the King at a rent of twelvepence
for every ploughland, to attend the Lord Deputy with a fixed
contingent, and to give free quarters for a limited number
of the gallowglasses in the royal service. He also undertook
to open up his country by cutting passes. O&#8217;Carroll at first
stipulated that Grey should help him to recover all his father&#8217;s
strongholds; but all those castles were already vested legally
in the Crown, and some of them had been granted to Ormonde.
The Council therefore objected, and Fergananim seems to
have waived his claim without demanding any corresponding
concession. The prudence of the Council had prevented the
Lord Deputy from concluding an offensive alliance; but he
acted as if he had done so, and proceeded to take Birr and
Modreeny, both of which Ormonde claimed under a royal
grant, and to attack Ballynaclogh. The latter place was
held by an O&#8217;Kennedy who paid rent to the Earl, and it
is within the bounds of Tipperary. O&#8217;Carroll boasted that
Nenagh and Roscrea would soon be his, and these castles,
though long in Irish hands, were part of the old Ormonde
inheritance, and had been lately confirmed to the Earl by a
new grant.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grey and
the
O&#8217;Mores.</div>

<p>Connell O&#8217;More, chief of Leix, died in 1537, and the inevitable
dispute followed between the tanist, his brother
Peter, and his sons, Lysaght, Kedagh, and Rory. Grey
espoused the cause of the sons, rather, as it seems, because
Ormonde sided with Peter than from any preference for
hereditary succession. Peter was, however, acknowledged
as chief, and met Parry, Grey&#8217;s confidential man, at Athy.
Rory, who was present, assaulted his uncle, and the latter was
then seized by Parry and carried to Dublin. Nothing was
proved against him, and he was restored on agreeing to pay
an annual tribute of twenty marks, and to receive a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
number of soldiers at free quarters. The young O&#8217;Mores
resisted the levying of the tribute, and Lysaght, the eldest,
was killed in a fray. They had all taken part in the murder
of Ormonde&#8217;s son Thomas five years before, and Kedagh and
Rory now plundered one of his villages. Their party consisted
of only eight men, but the neighbours pleaded that
they dared not resist, because the assailants were aided and
abetted by one of the Lord Deputy&#8217;s servants. The O&#8217;Mores
pleaded that the Earl had first attacked them, and he rejoined
that he had done so in self-defence. There was never a want
of excuses for violence on any side. Grey forbade the Earl
to retaliate, and it was even said that he shared the plunder.
The young O&#8217;Mores then attacked Tullow, but the Lord
Deputy still held Ormonde&#8217;s hand, and even sent guns to
help his enemies. Hoping to make peace, the Council summoned
both uncle and nephews to Dublin. The chief came
on Ormonde&#8217;s advice and practically under his protection,
and Kedagh also attended. O&#8217;More was at once sent handcuffed
to Maynooth, though the whole Council protested, and
Kedagh was suffered to depart unhurt. The blow to the
Earl&#8217;s credit was serious, and was not deadened by Grey, who
led his prisoner in chains about his own part of the country,
much as the Thane of Fife threatened to lead Macbeth. Grey&#8217;s
servants took the cue, and openly in the streets called the
Butlers traitors. Lord Butler vowed that unless absolutely
forced by his duty he would never wear armour under Grey
until he had seen the King, and he cited the example of Count
de R&oelig;ux, who had made a like vow when the Imperial lieutenant
Van Buren had forced him to make peace with France.
Even the old Earl meditated a journey to London, though he
was so infirm that he could only be carried in a litter. The
Irish Council condemned Grey&#8217;s treatment of O&#8217;More; and
moreover, said they, &#8216;it is no good policy for the King our
master, having no more obedient subjects in this land like
unto the said Earl and his son, of reputation in honour, force,
and strength, both to preserve and defend the parts where
they dwell, and to succour other his subjects in all events, to
suppress them which, with all their ancestors, have ever con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>tinued
their truths to the Crown of England, either upon the
accusation of those which for the most part have always done
the contrary, or yet in hope to have them now from henceforth
true, which hitherto were never true&#8217;&mdash;remarks which
have their practical value in modern Irish politics, as they
had in the days of Henry VIII.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sudden
departure
of Grey.</div>

<p>Though not too wise in council, Grey was prompt in
action, and was never so happy as on horseback surrounded
by armed men and free from interference. Perhaps he wished
to show how much he could do without Ormonde&#8217;s help. He
left Dublin suddenly, without warning the Council, and
attended only by a small force, his companions being under
the impression that he was bound only for an eight days&#8217;
journey into O&#8217;Carroll&#8217;s country. Among them was Lord
Gormanston, a son of Lord Delvin, John D&#8217;Arcy, William
Bermingham, O&#8217;Connor, Rory and Kedagh O&#8217;More, and several
other Irishmen of note, with a due proportion of kerne and
gallowglasses. Of English soldiers Grey had no more than
one hundred, and of these the greater part were without
armour. A hosting had been proclaimed against the O&#8217;Tooles,
who still kept some of the prisoners taken in Kelway&#8217;s raid,
and Grey promised to be back in time to lead the expedition.
He failed to do so, and a truce was with much difficulty concluded
with the mountaineers.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His rash
march into
Western
Munster,</div>

<p>Grey made his first halt at Monasteroris, where O&#8217;Connor
entertained him in the Franciscan friary. Next day he took
Eglish Castle near Birr from the O&#8217;Molloys, and was joined
by Kedagh O&#8217;More, O&#8217;Molloy, MacGeohegan, and MacGillapatrick,
each of whom brought a few men with him. On the
third day he entered Ely, and received the adhesion of Fergananim
O&#8217;Carroll, who bound himself by indenture on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
usual terms, and gave his son into the Lord Deputy&#8217;s hands.
Grey spent three days in reducing the lands of Birr and
Modreeny, the latter of which had to be taken by assault.
Ormonde had provided the garrison with arms; but, as he
alleged, these were intended only for use against Irish
enemies. Grey then entered Tipperary, and on three successive
days received the submissions of Dermot O&#8217;Kennedy,
chief of Ormonde, of MacBrien Arra, and of Dermot O&#8217;Mulryan,
chief of Owny. Ulick de Burgh, captain of Clanricarde, and
Theobald, head of the Clanwilliam Burkes, also submitted; and
James Fitzjohn of Desmond, to whom Grey gives the title of
Earl, though he was not acknowledged by the Crown, brought
a large contingent to the Deputy&#8217;s help, but refused to enter
the gates of Limerick. He had not only procured a safe-conduct,
but had solemnly bound O&#8217;Connor and others in
Grey&#8217;s train to take his part if any attempt were made against
him. The Lord Deputy spent a week in Limerick, where the
Mayor and Corporation and the Bishop took the oath of
supremacy. Connor O&#8217;Brien, the chief of Thomond, met
Grey on the Shannon, ten miles from Limerick, and agreed,
after a long wrangle, to put his son Tirlogh into the Deputy&#8217;s
hands. He also promised to do all in his power to promote
the capture of the castles held by his brother Murrough,
the tanist of Thomond. O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s Bridge was once more demolished,
Connor led the army through the tanist&#8217;s district,
and everything was destroyed as far as Clare Castle. Here
Grey and Desmond had a quarrel about the custody of
O&#8217;Mulryan&#8217;s hostages, and there was very near being a pitched
battle; but Sir Thomas Butler of Cahir, Ormonde&#8217;s son-in-law,
managed to patch up a truce. Grey was, in fact, quite at
O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s mercy, but the family politics saved him. The chief
had lately married a second wife, Lady Alice Fitzgerald of
Desmond, and Tirlogh, the child of the marriage, was pledged
to Grey; but Murrough the tanist and Donough, the chief&#8217;s
eldest son, were both afraid that the issue of the second
marriage would be preferred before them. O&#8217;Connor, in
whom Grey now placed implicit confidence, &#8216;and all sage men
of his band, both English and Irish,&#8217; begged him not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
venture among the O&#8217;Briens, and Edmund Sexton, a noted
royalist of Limerick, even conjured him on his allegiance not
to cast away the citizens&#8217; company, on whom all depended.
Grey refused to take advice, and escaped all dangers, chiefly
through Donough O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s influence. Donough&#8217;s loyalty
might not have been enough by itself, but he dreaded the
aggrandisement of Murrough more than possible dangers from
a half-brother who was still in his infancy. Guided by a
single gallowglass, who bore a silver axe adorned with silken
tassels, the army marched safely into Clanricarde. Ulick de
Burgh blamed Grey for his rashness, but he pointed to the
guide and said, &#8216;Lo! seest thou not yonder standing before
me O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s axe for my protection?&#8217; A modern traveller
among Arabs must often be content with some such outward
sign of invisible allies, but his trust in O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s axe was
made an article in Grey&#8217;s impeachment.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">And into
Connaught,
1538.</div>

<p>Ulick was fully acknowledged as chief of Clanricarde, to
the prejudice of his uncle Richard. He was believed to be
illegitimate, and the De Burghs, however much Hibernicised,
had hitherto preserved the English law of succession. The
precedent was therefore thought bad by many experienced
men, but the relationships of this family are so inextricably
confused that it is very hard to say who was legitimate and
who was not. The citizens of Galway remembered their
origin, and would take no money from the Lord Deputy, and
Ulick, who was knighted, took hospitable care of his Irish
allies. As at Limerick, the Mayor and Corporation took the
oath of supremacy, and so did the Archbishop of Tuam.
Grey made several forays into Clanricarde, with the apparent
object of strengthening Ulick; and O&#8217;Flaherty, two O&#8217;Maddens,
and Bermingham of Athenry, made their submissions. The
Lord Deputy then went towards the Suck in O&#8217;Kelly&#8217;s country,
and met O&#8217;Connor Roe, who rode with him to Aughrim.
Fording the Shannon at Banagher, the army passed through
the countries of O&#8217;Melaghlin and MacCoghlan, from whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
securities were exacted, and returned unmolested to Maynooth,
after an absence of thirty-eight days.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
this
journey.</div>

<p>As a military exploit Grey&#8217;s journey was by no means
contemptible, but his critics seem to have been right in thinking
it useless. The settled policy had long been to reduce
the tribes bordering on the Pale, and not to overrun districts
which there was no hope of holding. Many chiefs had come
to the Lord Deputy with loyal professions, but they had required
safe-conducts, had refused to enter walled towns, and
had given children for hostages. They had thus saved their
harvest, and the Government could scarcely take vengeance
on infants. Grey&#8217;s supposed partiality for the Geraldines
was probably the chief reason that he got back safely. He
had no sooner turned his back than James Fitzjohn of Desmond
seized Croom and Adare and threatened Ormonde&#8217;s
country. No difficulty had been lessened by an exploit which
was obviously open to the reproach of extreme rashness.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grey&#8217;s dispute
with
the Butlers.</div>

<p>Having got back their chief governor, the first care of
the Council was to reconcile him with the Butlers. The old
Earl&#8217;s appearance plainly foretold his approaching end, but he
came to Dublin and left his son to front the Desmonds and
O&#8217;Carrolls. Grey wrote to the latter to keep the peace, and
Lord Butler at once came to Dublin; but both father and son
refused to go to Maynooth, where they would be in the Lord
Deputy&#8217;s power. Kilmainham was at last fixed on as the
place of meeting, and Grey took the chair of state, but shook
hands with none of the Council, and smiled on no one. The
two Butlers offered to abide by the Council&#8217;s decision, but
Grey had already produced a paper reflecting on them for receiving
O&#8217;Connor after his defeat in the summer of 1537. A
Latin confession said to have been made by O&#8217;Connor in the
presence of Paulet and Berners was relied on, but the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
was secretly cross-examined by the Council, and so modified
his statement as to exonerate the Butlers completely. It
was said, for instance, that O&#8217;Connor had hired Edmond MacSwiney
and his free axes immediately after a conference with
Ormonde. O&#8217;Connor admitted the hiring, but explained that
the gallowglasses were not bound to levy war against the
King, and that Ormonde knew nothing at all about the
matter. Again, he was charged with retaining Scotch mercenaries,
who were allowed a fortnight&#8217;s free quarters in
Ormonde&#8217;s country. He admitted having brought in the
Scots; but the Earl had known nothing of it, and the free
quarters had not been given. Ormonde allowed that he had
harboured O&#8217;Connor, but pleaded the instructions of Grey,
who waited for orders from the King, and who was afraid of
driving the chief into fresh combinations with Irish enemies.
The probability is that O&#8217;Connor had at first been ready to
confess anything, because absolution was sure to follow, and
he is not likely to have been overflowing with Latin, which
was his only means of communicating with the English
officials.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">They
accuse each
other.</div>

<p>Both Grey and Ormonde gave in long written statements.
The Council desired to consider them in the Deputy&#8217;s absence,
and to this he with some hesitation consented. They found
that Grey&#8217;s charges contained nothing new, but only general
accusations of slackness; while Ormonde plainly accused Grey
of treasonable practices, of shaping his policy to suit young
Gerald of Kildare, and of systematically depressing all who
opposed the Geraldine faction. The indictment is summed
up in the comprehensive statement that &#8216;My Lord Deputy
cannot find in his heart to love or favour any man that is
preferred, favoured, or put in trust by his Majesty within
this his land, and would have none of them, though they be
all ready at his commandment, to be toward, or about him,
be they never so trusty nor so well meaning; but wholly
adhereth to those that were the counsellors, servants, and
followers of the disloyal Geraldines, and no men so nigh
about him as they, which either of his own prepensed mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
or being seducted by them, is like to bring this land to perdition
again.&#8217; On being pressed for proof, Ormonde said that
the facts were too notorious to require any.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Council

a reconciliation.</div>

<p>The Council prudently resolved not to let either litigant
see the other&#8217;s charges, and Mr. Justice St. Lawrence having
been called in, the originals were burned in his presence.
Copies already taken were transmitted to London. Ormonde
and his son then swore to serve the Lord Deputy loyally. Grey
swore not to use them spitefully nor ask them to perform impossibilities,
to deliver Modreeny to the Earl unless O&#8217;Carroll
could show a better title, and to cause the young O&#8217;Mores to
restore the plunder of Ormonde&#8217;s villages, or at least to refer
all to the Council. The Council did not believe the agreement
would be lasting. &#8216;Neither,&#8217; they added, &#8216;can we perceive
(whereof we be sorry) that my Lord Deputy is meet to make
long abode here, for he is so haughty and chafing that men
be afeard to speak to him, doubting his bravish lightness.
Nevertheless, it is much pity of him, for he is an active
gentleman.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Kavanaghs.
The
O&#8217;Reillys.</div>

<p>It was not long before the Butlers had an opportunity
of co-operating with Grey. The Kavanaghs threatened the
Wexford colony, negotiations failed, and it became necessary
to chastise them. Grey entered Carlow in person, and was
joined by Saintloo, who, whatever his shortcomings as a
governor, was not a bad soldier, and who brought 800 men.
After fourteen days&#8217; burning and plundering, MacMurrough
and his clansmen sued for peace, and agreed to hold their
lands of the King. Grey then moved northwards, and provisions
for eight days were prepared for a raid against O&#8217;Reilly,
to be used otherwise by the Deputy in case O&#8217;Reilly should
make timely submission. O&#8217;Reilly did submit, and Grey went
to Dundalk with a view of meeting O&#8217;Neill, who was now
young Gerald Fitzgerald&#8217;s protector. O&#8217;Neill broke his
appointment, and he did wisely, for Grey says he was determined
to take Gerald if possible, &#8216;and if not, by the oath
that I have made to my sovereign lord and master, I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
have taken the said O&#8217;Neill and a kept him till he had caused

<div class="sidenote">The
Savages in
Down.</div>

<p>Foiled in this attempt, which can hardly be described as
otherwise than treacherous, Grey determined to chastise the
Savages, who had refused to pay rent to Brabazon, the King&#8217;s
tenant in Lecale. This old English family had become quite
Hibernicised, and were now bringing Scotch mercenaries into
the country. Various castles were taken and delivered to
Brabazon, who also took charge of Dundrum, an important
stronghold belonging to Magennis, which commanded the
entry to Lecale on the land side. The Scots fled, leaving
corn, butter, and other rural plunder behind. Grey was much
struck by the fertility of the district, which is still famous.
&#8216;I never,&#8217; he said, &#8216;saw a pleasanter plot than Lecale for
commodity of the land, and divers islands in the same environed
in the sea, which were soon reclaimed and inhabited,

<div class="sidenote">Labours of
St. Leger&#8217;s
Commission.</div>

<p>Sir Anthony St. Leger and his brother Commissioners
arrived in Ireland early in September 1537, and lost no time
in endeavouring to carry out the King&#8217;s plan. By November
they had surveyed most of the King&#8217;s lands in Carlow, Kilkenny,
Tipperary, Waterford, Dublin, and Kildare. The
general result of their observations was that they had seen
&#8216;divers goodly manors and castles, the more part of them
ruinous, and in great decay, the towns and lands about them
depopulate, wasted, and not manured; whereby hath ensued
great dearth and scarcity of all manner victuals.&#8217; But few
applications were made for leases, because there was no security,
and they saw the necessity of placing a few castles in
a defensible state. Within reach of the walls there was no
difficulty in getting tenants. By Christmas the survey was
finished, and an increased desire to take leases was quickly
manifested; but some lands were still unlet. Two thousand
marks in money and securities had been collected for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
King, &#8216;and much more,&#8217; the Commissioners reported, &#8216;would
have been levied, in case that men had not of late been sore
charged with service doing to his Highness here, whereby
we be constrained to look on them with more favourable eye.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The public
accounts.</div>

<p>Brabazon reported that the Commissioners had done their
work well. The passing of his own three years&#8217; account was
a yet more difficult matter. They found it tedious and intricate,
both from its nature and from the fact that there were
no records of the King&#8217;s ancient inheritance, or of escheats.
Brabazon&#8217;s own arrangements were good, but all before his
time was chaos. &#8216;Every keeper,&#8217; said the Master of the
Rolls, &#8216;for his time, as he favoured, so did either embezzle,
or suffer to be embezzled, such muniments as should make
against them and their friends, so that we have little to show
for any of the King&#8217;s lands or profits in these parts: it is
therefore necessary that from henceforth all the rolls and
muniments to be had be put in good order in Bermingham&#8217;s
Tower, and the door thereof to have two locks, and the keys
thereof one to be with the Constable, and the other with the
Under-Treasurer, which likewise it is necessary to be an
Englishman born; and that no man be suffered to have loan
of any of the said muniments, nor to search, view, or read
any of them there, but in the presence of one of the keepers
aforesaid.&#8217; The accounts were nevertheless put in order by
March; and having received very gracious thanks from the
King, St. Leger and his colleagues returned to England,
&#8216;not,&#8217; as they were careful to note, &#8216;for that we be weary to
serve his Grace, but for because we be very loth to spend
any more of his treasure, than we see time to serve him.&#8217;
Aylmer and Alen, by the King&#8217;s especial orders, accompanied
the High Commissioners to England.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cromwell
and the
Irish
service.</div>

<p>The official politicians of Ireland generally took care to
be on good terms with the virtual ruler of England, and to
watch for every sign of change in the distribution of royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
favours. Cromwell was therefore well bespattered with flattery;
but there were murmurs, some at least of which reached
his ears. St. Leger the discreet may or may not have glanced
obliquely at the Lord Privy Seal when he said of himself that
&#8216;he had too long abstained from bribery to begin now.&#8217; But
his colleague George Paulet was more outspoken, and declared
openly that &#8216;the Lord Privy Seal drew every day towards his
death, and that he escaped very hardly at the last insurrection,
and that he was the greatest briber in England, and that
he was espied well enough.&#8217; Cromwell had given orders that
the Commissioners should not interfere with castles in Lord
Butler&#8217;s possession, and to this Paulet objected, hinting that
Butler&#8217;s head as well as Cromwell&#8217;s might easily be disposed
of. His reading of Henry&#8217;s character was exactly the same
as Wolsey&#8217;s. &#8216;I will,&#8217; he said, &#8216;so work matters that the
King shall be informed of every penny that he hath spent
here; and when that great expense is once in his head, it
shall never be forgotten; there is one good point. And then
I will inform him how he hath given away to one man 700
marks by year, and then will the King swear &#8220;By God&#8217;s
Body, have I spent so much money and have given away
my land.&#8221; I will find the means to put the matter in the
King&#8217;s head, after that wise as shall be to his displeasure;
and yet shall he not know which way it came.&#8217; Paulet gave
Alen a most amusing description of the fashion in which
Henry treated the minister to whom he gave such power.
&#8216;The King beknaveth him twice a week and sometimes
knocks him well about the pate; and yet when he hath been
well pommelled about the head, and shaken up as it were a
dog, he will come out into the great chamber shaking of his
bush with as merry a countenance as though he might rule
all the roast.&#8217; The appointment of the High Commissioners
was a &#8216;flym flawe to stop the imagination of the King and
Council&#8217; as to Cromwell&#8217;s object in promoting great grants
to Lord Butler. The suggestion of course is that Cromwell
was bribed by Butler, and the fact that Paulet was not
punished shows that there were limitations to the minister&#8217;s
power. Paulet said as much, or nearly as much, to Grey as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
to Alen and Aylmer, and Grey repeated it to the King with
some softening of the words. Paulet was evidently hostile to
the Butlers; so was Grey, and the fact that they had been on
friendly terms was thought evidence of their conspiring in
the Geraldine interest.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Charges

Circuit of

in the
South,
1539.</div>

<p>Aylmer and Alen were less than two months in London,
but they left behind them a mass of accusations against Grey
which in time brought forth fruit. Alen soon afterwards
received the Great Seal, and during the last days of 1538
proceeded on a tour in the South with the general view of
establishing the King&#8217;s supremacy, of improving the revenue,
and of providing for the administration of justice. Archbishop
Browne, Brabazon, and Aylmer accompanied the new
Chancellor. At Carlow the party enjoyed Lord Butler&#8217;s
Christmas hospitalities, and the old Earl treated them well
at Kilkenny, where they spent New Year&#8217;s day, and where
Browne preached to a large congregation. English translations
of the Pater Noster, Ave Maria, Articles, and Ten Commandments
were published, and copies given to the Bishop
and other dignitaries, who were ordered to promulgate them
wherever they had jurisdiction. Next morning several felons
were hanged, and certain concealed lands sequestrated to the
King&#8217;s use; neither of which proceedings were calculated to
increase his Majesty&#8217;s popularity. The councillors then went
to Ross, which they found much decayed through the rivalry
of Waterford and the disorders of the Kavanaghs. Here the
Archbishop preached again. At Wexford there was another
sermon, and the Kilkenny ceremonies were repeated, including
the execution of divers malefactors. The Councillors
were dissatisfied with Saintloo&#8217;s conduct as seneschal, and
accused him of converting fines and forfeited recognizances
to his own use. Badly armed and badly horsed, the soldiers
appeared to do the people less good by their protection than
they did harm by their extortion. The evils inherent to all
palatinate jurisdictions were greatly aggravated by the seneschal&#8217;s
lax administration. It was doubtful whether he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the right to appoint a deputy at all. He had nevertheless
made such an appointment by parole and without any formal
record, and his irregular substitute had arrogated all the
powers of a Judge of Assize.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>From Wexford Alen and his companions went to Waterford,
where Browne preached to a great audience, and where
the new formularies were again published. The usual hangings
followed. Four felons suffered, &#8216;accompanied with
another thief, a friar, whom, among the residue, we commanded
to be hanged in his habit, and so to remain upon the
gallows, for a mirror to all other his brethren to live truly.&#8217;
The assizes or sessions were attended only by the inhabitants
of Lord Power&#8217;s portion of the county of Waterford. The
other and larger division of the shire belonged to Gerald
MacShane of Decies, who pretended to hold of the Desmonds,
and altogether ignored his tenure of the royal honour of
Dungarvan. The Lord of Decies, James Fitzjohn of Desmond,
the White Knight, and Sir Thomas Butler of Cahir were
summoned with several others. Butler came to Clonmel and
made a favourable impression, but the Geraldines sent only
&#8216;frivolous, false, feigned excuses, not consonant to their
allegiance.&#8217; Browne preached again at Clonmel in the presence
of two archbishops and eight bishops, all of whom
afterwards, before the whole congregation, took the oath of
supremacy, and swore to maintain the succession as established
by law.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>After much pressing, the inhabitants of Wexford, Waterford,

of the other three. This source of revenue was quite new, and
the Council were very proud of inventing it; but they con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>fessed
to doubts as to its substantial value, especially in
Waterford, where Sir Gerald MacShane had power to pay
or to withhold. From Clonmel the councillors returned to
Dublin by Kilkenny, where they hanged one man more and
levied some further fines. They had been absent from the
capital five weeks.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grey in
Ulster.
The Scots,
1539.</div>

<p>About the time that the Chancellor and his companions
were turning homewards, Grey undertook another expedition
against O&#8217;Neill. Again the ostensible object was to catch
young Gerald of Kildare, and in this the Lord Deputy failed.
But he very nearly caught O&#8217;Neill himself, actually carried
off his &#8216;housewife,&#8217; and ravaged much of his country. O&#8217;Donnell
was present, or at least some of his people, for the horse
which his standard-bearer rode was taken. James Fitzjohn
of Desmond was in alliance with the two great northern
chiefs to protect the &#8216;naughty boy,&#8217; as Alen called Gerald,
and if possible to force the King to restore him. The bastard
Geraldines of the Pale were ready to help their natural leader,
who grew more dangerous as he grew older. The Antrim
Scots were always available for service against the English
Government, and Brabazon wished to cripple them by a
naval expedition. O&#8217;Neill and O&#8217;Donnell now sent Roderick
O&#8217;Donnell, Bishop of Derry, to Scotland for 6,000 Redshanks.
In the meantime they professed themselves ready to treat
with Grey, and promised to bring young Gerald to meet him
on the last day of April at Carrick Bradagh, near Dundalk.
They never came, and Grey penetrated to Armagh in spite
of bad weather and foul ways. O&#8217;Neill still refused to show
himself or to give any hostage, but he professed peaceable
intentions. The weather made it impossible to advance further,
and Aylmer was sent to Blackwater, where he succeeded
in making a truce. Again, Grey says that he had intended
to seize his nephew by fair means or foul. &#8216;If they had
kept pointment with me having young Gerald with them,
howsoever the thing had chanced by the oath that I have
made unto your Grace, they should have left the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Gerald behind them quick or dead. If it were the pleasure
of God I would that I might once have a sight of him whom
as yet I never saw with my eyes.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
O&#8217;Tooles.</div>

<p>The O&#8217;Tooles had never been punished for their victory
over Kelway, and Grey, who had for the moment no worse
enemy than a gouty foot, resolved to chastise them. They
proposed to parley near Ballymore Eustace, but did not come.
Though in great pain, Grey rode to Powerscourt in a day,
entered the mountains and penetrated to Glenmalure, cutting
the woods on both sides as he went. &#8216;Before my coming
thither,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I think there never was Deputy with carts
there.&#8217; He had some skirmishing with the natives, but took
no man of importance, and returned to Maynooth without
having improved his gout.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Intrigues
concerning
Gerald of
Kildare.</div>

<p>A confederacy had at this time been formed in favour of
young Gerald. His own claims might not have been enough,
in spite of Lady Eleanor O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s efforts, but Henry&#8217;s
ecclesiastical policy was beginning to bear its natural fruit.
Priests passed from chief to chief, and communications with
Rome were frequent. The Irish said all Englishmen were
heretics, and the King the &#8216;most heretic and worst man in
the world,&#8217; in which perhaps they were not far wrong. They
considered Henry a disobedient Papal vassal, and a mere
usurper in Ireland. &#8216;When Dr. Nangle, my suffragan,&#8217; says
Archbishop Browne, &#8216;showed the King&#8217;s broad seal for justifying
of his authority, MacWilliam little esteemed it, but
threw it away and vilipended the same.&#8217; The plan was that
O&#8217;Toole, to whom Gerald promised to restore Powerscourt,
should harass the Pale from the south, while James Fitzjohn
of Desmond, with some Scotch mercenaries, attacked it from
the west and O&#8217;Neill from the north. If Tara could be
reached O&#8217;Neill might be proclaimed King of Ireland, and
Gerald restored to his own in Kildare. Besides her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
friends, Lady Eleanor commanded the services of a Bristol
captain named Kate, or Cappys, who spoke Irish fluently
and owned his own ship. John Lynch, a Galway merchant,
met him at Assaroe, on the Donegal coast, and warned some
of the confederates that Grey would be too strong for them,
and that he was active enough to surprise them when they
thought he was amusing himself. But Delahide, Leverous,
and others, answered that they had perfect intelligence, that
Grey could not ride twenty miles in the Pale without their
knowledge, that his army consisted chiefly of churls and
ploughmen, of which 300 might easily be vanquished by 100,
and that he had no good officers under him. These are the
arguments with which the foes of order in Ireland have always
deluded their adherents, and sometimes themselves.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Catholic
movement.</div>

<p>Wherever Lynch went he found the priests preaching daily
&#8216;that every man ought for the salvation of his soul fight and
make war against our sovereign lord the King&#8217;s Majesty and his
true subjects; and if any of them which so shall fight against
his said Majesty or his subjects, die in the quarrel, his soul that
so shall be dead shall go to heaven as the soul of St. Peter, Paul,
and others, which suffered death and martyrdom for God&#8217;s
sake.&#8217; &#8216;And forasmuch,&#8217; Lynch adds, &#8216;as I did traverse somewhat
of such words, I was cast out of church and from their
masses during a certain time of days for an heretic; and I
was greatly afraid.&#8217; The result of all this preaching was an
invasion of the Pale in the month of August. Lord Butler&#8217;s
policy had kept the O&#8217;Briens quiet, and nothing was done on
that side. But O&#8217;Donnell and O&#8217;Neill entered Meath with
the greatest army, as some thought, that had ever been seen
in Ireland. There was a large contingent of Scots, both
from the mainland and the islands, and most of the Northern
chiefs added their quotas to the host. O&#8217;Neill of Clandeboye,
O&#8217;Rourke, Maguire, MacQuillin, O&#8217;Cahan, Magennis, and
MacDermot are among those mentioned. Tara was reached,
but no restoration of the ancient kingdom followed. Much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
damage was done to the modern kingdom, including the
burning of Ardee and of Navan, which was the best market
town in the county. The invaders set fire to the standing
corn, carried off every portable article of value, and, sweeping
all the cattle before them, turned in high spirits northwards.
They had met with no enemy, and had probably attained
their object of providing funds for a general rising, which
was fixed for September 1, and which James of Desmond was
expected to join.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grey routs

<p>Grey summoned the men of Dublin and Drogheda, those
citizen soldiers whom the Irish dreaded so much, and hurried
after O&#8217;Neill. Out of a nominal 350 he could muster no
more than 140 of his own men, but he had some help from
the gentlemen of the Pale. The marchers, like Rob Roy at
Sheriffmuir, waited to see which was the winning side. &#8216;I

with you.&#8217; Without waiting for such Laodiceans, the Lord
Deputy dashed forward, and, as Lynch had foreseen, caught
the Ulstermen quite unprepared. They were encamped at
Bellahoe, the ford which divides Meath from Monaghan, on
the Farney side of the water, and he routed them before they
had time to form. The Irish leaders who knew the country
escaped, with the exception of Magennis, whose post was near
the ford. He fell into the hands of the Louth men, who were
bribed by some of his own clan to kill him, and did so. The
only person of note killed on the English side was a gentleman
named Mape, who charged up the river bank by Lord Slane&#8217;s
side, and who was carried by his runaway horse into the
midst of the Irish. According to Stanihurst, whose account
of this affair is at least highly coloured, the mayors of
Dublin and Drogheda and Thomas Talbot of Malahide were
dubbed knights on the field by the Lord Deputy. He also
says that Black James Fleming, Baron of Slane, led the
attack, and called on his hereditary standard-bearer to do his
duty in the front. But the standard-bearer, whose name was
Robert Halpin or Halfpenny, thought the service desperate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
and refused to advance his banner, preferring &#8216;to sleep in an
whole sheepskin his pelt, than to walk in a torn lion his
skin.&#8217; Calling him a dastardly coward, the Baron ordered
Robert Betagh to supply his place, which he cheerfully did:
Mape, though he had refused to lead, was fain to follow, and
fell fighting in the first rank.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grey is
accused of
favouring
the Geraldines.</div>

<p>After this great success, which shattered the Irish or
Catholic confederacy for a time, Grey remained in the North.
A fleet had been collected at Carlingford to chastise the
Scots, and the crews had taken part in the fight or pursuit at
Bellahoe; but not much could be done against the islanders.
The old Earl of Ormonde had just died, and his son was too
busy to visit Ulster. He had incurred vast expense in subsidising
the O&#8217;Briens and the Clanricarde Burkes, who were
ready to serve the King with 800 gallowglasses, 800 kerne,
and some horse. James Fitzjohn of Desmond was growing
daily stronger, while his rival was basking in Court sunshine;
and Ormonde attributed this state of affairs to the Lord
Deputy, who favoured all Geraldines and depressed all who
owed their promotion to Cromwell. James Fitzjohn had seen
the Earl&#8217;s brother, the Archbishop of Cashel, and had promised
to meet Ormonde also, but he failed in his appointment,
and threatened at every moment to attack Tipperary.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Desmond
heritage.
Grey goes
to Munster,
1539.</div>

<p>The English Government had in the meantime declared
that James FitzMaurice was right heir to the earldom of Desmond.
He had been a royal page, and was provided with a
force sufficient to guard against any sudden attack. He
landed at Cork or Youghal in August, but three months
elapsed before any serious effort was made to put him in
possession of his own. Leaving Dublin early in November,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Grey joined Ormonde near Roscrea, about which there had
been fierce dissensions. The castle was now in the hands of
the O&#8217;Meaghers, but they gave it up peaceably to the Lord
Deputy, and he handed it over to Ormonde. Modreeny,
which the Earl now acknowledged as O&#8217;Carroll&#8217;s, was also
surrendered. Taking hostages from O&#8217;Carroll, MacBrien
Arra, O&#8217;Kennedy, O&#8217;Mulryan, and O&#8217;Dwyer to be faithful
and pay the King tribute, Grey and Ormonde cut passes
through the woods near the Shannon, the inhabitants of which
had guided the O&#8217;Briens in their raids. They halted two
days at Thurles, where Sir Gerald MacShane and the White
Knight thought it prudent to submit themselves, and victualled
their troops about Cashel and Clonmel. At Youghal
they delivered all the castles of Imokilly to the young Earl
of Desmond, and two nephews of former Earls accepted him
as the head of their House. At Cork Lord Barry, who had
held aloof for years, came in and gave security. Hither also
came the sons of Cormac Oge, and it was probably on this
occasion that their sister Mary MacCarthy married the young
Earl. The union was not fated to last long, nor to give an
heir to the House of Desmond. The barony of Kerrycurrihy
was taken possession of at Kinsale, and MacCarthy Reagh, in
whose castle of Kilbrittain Gerald of Kildare had lately found
a home, consented to come to Cork and to give his brother as
a hostage. He hesitated to sacrifice his cattle, and was easily
persuaded by Ormonde, who was now on unusually good
terms with Grey. Barry Roe and Barry Oge also gave security.
The army then shifted to O&#8217;Callaghan&#8217;s country, and
near Dromaneen James Fitzjohn came to the other side of the
flooded Blackwater and defied Grey. He would, he said,
conclude nothing without the advice of O&#8217;Brien, who could
dispose of all the Irishry of Ireland. Grey could not pass the
river, and returned to Cork. John Travers, a native of Ireland
who had learned the art of war elsewhere, had lately
been appointed Master of the Ordnance, and accompanied
this expedition, in which only 800 men were employed.
Travers said that he would go anywhere in Ireland with 2,000
men, and Grey&#8217;s exploits, no less than Sidney&#8217;s later, show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
that he was right: the difficulty was not to take but to keep.
&#8216;Six thousand good men,&#8217; Travers added, &#8216;divided in three
places as I could give instruction, with certain craftsmen to inhabit
the places they win, might make a general reformation
in one summer.&#8217; The advice was sound, but the Crown could
not afford to take it.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grey&#8217;s last
raid into
Ulster.</div>

<p>Once more before young Gerald had left Ireland did Grey
turn his attention to the North. For the third time O&#8217;Neill
promised to meet him, and for the third time he failed to
appear. Without victuals, and trusting to plunder for the
support of his men, the Lord Deputy then rode &#8216;thirty-four
miles of ill way&#8217; to Dungannon, and again nearly caught the
troublesome chief. But the guides, perhaps intentionally,
delayed the soldiers on their night march, and daybreak
found them still five miles from Dungannon. O&#8217;Neill had
time to escape. Six days were spent in promiscuous burnings,
during which the soldiers had no bread and lived on
freshly killed beef: it is no wonder that disease was rife in
the ranks. This was Grey&#8217;s last warlike expedition; successful
in a certain sense, but quite useless as a matter of
policy.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Recall of
Grey.
Consequent
confusion.</div>

<p>Grey had often asked leave to go to Court and lay the state
of Ireland before the King, begging that his adversaries might
not be allowed to ruin him behind his back. His request
was now to be granted in an unexpected manner. One of
his last acts in Ireland was a quarrel with the Council, in
spite of whose remonstrances he sent over Travers, the Master
of the Ordnance, with despatches, though he seems to have
agreed with them that a man who could be better spared
would have done the business just as well. Sir William
Brereton, Marshal of the Army, had lately broken his leg, an
accident from which he seems never to have fully recovered;
Edward Griffiths, another useful officer, was dying of diarrh&oelig;a;
Travers was the only available officer, and his own department
was in bad order. Yet Grey sent him, perhaps because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
he thought his talk would be favourable to him. The immediate
result of Travers&#8217;s journey was that the King sent for
Grey, professing his anxiety to see him and to send him back
to Ireland in time for the fighting season at the end of May.
Brereton was to act as Lord Justice during his absence.
Henry declared himself willing to raise the wages of soldiers
in Ireland, which had been fixed three years before at 5<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
a year for horsemen and half that sum for footmen, and which
had been found quite inadequate. Deplorable disorders had
resulted from the necessities of the men. Henry expressed
his intention of keeping the troops on the Irish borders instead
of in Dublin. Coming events cast their accustomed shadow
before, and Grey&#8217;s recall, for recall it was understood to be,
was known to the public sooner than to the officials. It was
of course suggested that Grey purposely concealed the truth
in order to embarrass the Council; and he refused their prayer
to stay until arrangements had been made for the defence of
the Pale. His activity had evidently inspired respect, for he
had no sooner crossed the Channel than the O&#8217;Tooles made a
raid towards Dublin. O&#8217;Byrne warned the citizens, and they
had time to make ready. The Kavanaghs attacked the Wexford
settlers. The O&#8217;Connors burned Kildare. Alen and
Brabazon had also been called to England, but they were
obliged to wait for a fitter time. &#8216;The country,&#8217; wrote Brereton
in excusing their absence, &#8216;is in very ill case, being assured
of no Irishman&#8217;s peace.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Trial and
execution
of Grey.</div>

<p>An enormous number of charges were brought against
Grey. He was accused of maintaining the King&#8217;s enemies
and depressing the King&#8217;s friends, of injustice to Irishmen
and others, of violence towards Councillors and others, and
of extortion. There is no reason to suppose that he could
have taken young Gerald, with whom, in Stanihurst&#8217;s quaint
language, he was accused of &#8216;playing bo-peep;&#8217; but no doubt
he had been guilty of much injustice, as his unprovoked in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>vasion
of Ferney and his treatment of O&#8217;More sufficiently
prove. He cannot be called a man of scrupulous honour, or
he would not have arrested the Geraldines at dinner, or professed
his intention to capture his nephew by fair means or
foul. But Henry VIII. knew how to pardon such conduct,
though he could punish his instruments when it suited him.
The Irish chiefs felt that they could not trust Grey, and
therefore kept no faith with him. He was accused on all
sides of greed, and especially of making useless expeditions
for the sake of plunder. The usual inquisition made after
his arrest shows that he had some private hoards. He was
violent in Council, and no doubt it was often hard for a
Viceroy, especially for one who suffered from gout, to deal
with the Dublin officials, who were independent of him and
sometimes spies on his conduct. &#8216;I think,&#8217; says Walter
Cowley, &#8216;there is not one of the King&#8217;s Council there but
my Lord Deputy successively have sore fallen out with them.&#8217;
But he was rude and tyrannical to others also, as to Lord
Delvin, whose life he was accused of shortening by insults,
and especially by calling him traitor, &#8216;which,&#8217; says the old
Earl of Ormonde, &#8216;shall never be proved.&#8217; In any case and
whatever his actual guilt, a cloud of witnesses appeared to
denounce Grey.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> He pleaded guilty, rather in hopes of mercy
than acknowledging his faults; but no pardon followed. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
he had any treasonable intention is more than doubtful, but
there was more against him than against Buckingham; he
suffered a year&#8217;s imprisonment in the Tower, and then underwent
the fate to which his treacherous compliance with a
tyrant&#8217;s wishes had condemned his Geraldine kinsmen.</p>

Aylmer and Alen in S.P., vol. iii. No. 237, and their letter to St. Leger,
June 27, 1538; Ormonde to Cowley, July 16 and 20; the Council of Ireland&#8217;s
Articles, Oct. 1540; Stanihurst. The Articles of the Council seem to have
been carefully scrutinised by Wriothesley. In his letter to the King of
July 20, 1540, O&#8217;Neill says Grey, &#8216;guerras et contentiones in partibus istis
seminavit sui lucrandi causâ.&#8217; On June 20, 1538, Lord Butler writes to
Cowley that &#8216;our governor threatens every man after such a tyrannous
sort, as no man dare speak openly or repugn against his appetite;&#8217; and on
July 20, his father says, &#8216;the Lord Deputy is occupied without the advice
of the Council, for his own private lucre and gain.&#8217; On the trial of Strafford
Oliver St. John&mdash;the man who said that &#8216;stone-dead hath no fellow&#8217;&mdash;cited
Grey&#8217;s case as a precedent for trying in England treasons committed
in Ireland. Grey was Viscount Grane in Ireland, but he was declared no
peer, and tried as a commoner in England; see Howell&#8217;s <cite>State Trials</cite>. As
to Grey&#8217;s private hoards, see a letter from R. Cowley to Norfolk, printed by
Ellis, second series, No. 126, and wrongly placed under 1538; it belongs to

<p>With the usual plundering inroads on the Pale Brereton was
able to cope; and the greater chieftains were quiet, for Gerald
of Kildare was safe. O&#8217;Donnell, who may have resented his
treatment by Lady Eleanor, readily reverted to his father&#8217;s
policy, and no difficulty was made about his pardon. O&#8217;Neill
held aloof, but again professed himself ready to come to
Carrick Bradagh. Again he failed to appear, and pleaded
that he dared not approach Dundalk through fear of Grey&#8217;s
manifest treachery. He offered to come to Magennis&#8217;s Castle
at Narrowater, a beautiful spot near the mouth of the Newry
river and the foot of the Mourne Mountains. Brereton agreed,
and a meeting at last took place. O&#8217;Neill declared his readiness
to perform all that he had promised to Skeffington, to
send a trusty messenger to the King, and to leave pardon or
punishment for the past to the royal discretion. Till the
answer came he was content to be at peace with the Government,
and to keep his neighbours quiet. He was at this
time intriguing with Scotland, and his secretary was actually
at Edinburgh. Cromwell had received information that eight
Irishmen had been with the Scottish King, to whom they
had brought sealed letters from the principal chiefs, containing
offers to take him as their lord and to do homage to him.
It was even said that James meditated an invasion of Ireland
in person. O&#8217;Neill probably waited for the result of these
negotiations before sending a confidential servant with a letter
to Henry. He begged the King not to send his enemies into
his country, where Grey had, as he affirmed, sowed dissensions
from selfish motives. He was willing to do anything
he was asked unless the new Lord Deputy should prove very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
extortionate, and he advised the King not to waste his money
in Ulster. Henry answered graciously, and acknowledged some
trifling presents which accompanied the chief&#8217;s letter. Future
royal favours, his Majesty was careful to point out, must
depend on performance and not on promises. Pardon in
the meantime would be granted for the heinous offences
committed.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Murder of
James FitzMaurice,
Earl of
Desmond,
1540.</div>

<p>With the sea at hand, and Ormonde ever ready to help
him, it was supposed that James FitzMaurice would be able
to maintain himself as Earl of Desmond. At first he confined
himself to Kerrycurrihy and Imokilly, but after three
months he was tempted to go inland towards the Limerick
district, in which James Fitzjohn&#8217;s strength lay. Near
Fermoy he was set upon and murdered by his rival&#8217;s brother,
who had earned the title of &#8216;Maurice of the Burnings.&#8217; James
Fitzjohn, who now believed himself to be undisputed Earl, at
once repaired to Youghal, where he was well received and
joined by all the chiefs who had lately made such professions
to Grey and Ormonde. The garrison had, through over-confidence,
withdrawn to Waterford. Gerald of Kildare had just
escaped to France, and the web of policy which the English
Government had cast over both branches of the Geraldines
was torn to pieces for the time.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">James

<p>There was no evidence of James Fitzjohn&#8217;s complicity in
his cousin&#8217;s murder, and Ormonde received the King&#8217;s authority
to pardon him, if he could be brought to promise good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
behaviour. He preferred to ally himself with O&#8217;Brien, and
pleaded that Irish confederacies were too strong for him to
withstand. To gain his confidence Ormonde risked his own
person in the Desmond country for two nights, and passed
right through it to parley with O&#8217;Brien, who refused to listen
to anything. But Desmond would not show himself, and
Ormonde then went for a few weeks to England. On his
return he found that little harm had been done, and this he
attributed solely to O&#8217;Brien having been out of his mind.
But Desmond claimed the credit of holding his hand. &#8216;In
like,&#8217; he wrote to Ormonde, &#8216;I desire you, according to my
full trust, for to bring me in the King&#8217;s favour the best ye can;
and in case that his Grace will so accept me, I trust we shall
both be able to do his Grace acceptable service according to our
duty.&#8217; On his return from England Ormonde at once resumed
negotiations, and St. Leger had been scarcely a month in
Ireland before he received friendly letters both from Desmond
and O&#8217;Brien.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fall of
Cromwell.
St. Leger
is made
Deputy,
1541.</div>

<p>In the meantime Cromwell&#8217;s head had fallen on the
scaffold to which he had sent so many better men. Grey
was in the Tower, and Henry found time to appoint a new
Lord Deputy. He chose Sir Anthony St. Leger, who
already knew much of Ireland, and whose temper would at
least save him from his predecessor&#8217;s chief faults. Sir Patrick
Barnewall of Fieldston, an eminent lawyer, had lately enumerated
the qualities desirable in a chief governor, and in so
doing had drawn a heavy indictment against the last holder
of that high office. The King, he said, should provide a
Deputy &#8216;faithful, sure, and constant in his promise, and in
especial to any concluding of peace; and that he shall be
such a person that shall have more regard to his own honour
and promise than to any covetous desire of preys or booties of
cattle; and that he shall make no wilful war, and when war is
made upon a good ground, that the same be followed till a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
perfect conclusion thereof be taken, and not left at large, nor
yet to take a faint peace; and that the said Deputy shall not
be in weighty causes counselled nor guided by such persons
as be openly known to be ill-doers, or apt adherents of
the ill-doers in their ill-doings against the King&#8217;s Majesty
and his Grace&#8217;s subjects in time past, for the same hath and
may hinder.&#8217; In selecting St. Leger, Henry was probably
actuated in part by such motives, and in part by hopes of an
increased income. With him were associated as Revenue
Commissioners Thomas Walsh, Baron, and John Mynne,
Auditor of the English Exchequer, and William Cavendish,
Treasurer of the Court of Augmentations; but the viceregal
authority was not in any way impaired.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Leger&#8217;s
policy.
The Kavanaghs.</div>

<p>St. Leger seems clearly to have grasped the idea so often
put forth and so often neglected, that the pacification of Ireland
must begin with the neighbourhood of the Pale, and
that distant expeditions were neither lightly to be undertaken
nor abandoned without attaining their object. He resolved
at once to punish those who had attacked the Pale at Grey&#8217;s
departure, and he turned first to the Kavanaghs. Ormonde
had lately ravaged Idrone for a week and taken hostages,
reporting that all the mischief was done by Donnell MacCahir,
&#8216;who, having nothing to lose, adhereth to Tirlogh O&#8217;Toole.&#8217;
St. Leger now ravaged the territory far and wide, and at the
end of ten days the chief came in and submitted. He renounced
the name of MacMurrough, and agreed to hold his
lands of the Crown by knight-service. After the manner of
Deputies in their early days of office, St. Leger believed that
he had really made a final settlement. The Kavanaghs were
ready enough to make promises, and even to boast their
descent from the man who first brought the English to Ireland;
but St. Leger was destined to have plenty of trouble
with them.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

O&#8217;Mores
and
O&#8217;Connors,
and their
neighbours.</div>

<p>Offaly had been so often devastated that the new Lord
Deputy could have little to do in that way; but the adjoining
district of Leix had been more fortunate, and its turn now
came. The O&#8217;Doynes, O&#8217;Dempseys, and others were separated
by St. Leger&#8217;s policy from O&#8217;Connor, whom it was proposed
to bridle by establishing fortified posts at Kinnegad in Westmeath,
at Kishevan in Kildare, at Castle Jordan in Meath,
and at Ballinure in what is now the King&#8217;s County. A letter
arrived from the King with orders to expel O&#8217;Connor from
his country and to give it to his brother Cahir, if he would
behave in a civilised manner, as he had often promised to do.
The incorrigible rebel should be made an example to all
Ireland by his perpetual exile and just punishment. But this
could not be honourably done, for Brereton had made a peace
during the difficult days that followed Grey&#8217;s recall, and
O&#8217;Connor, whose submission was of the humblest, had done
no harm since then. St. Leger indeed showed some inconsistency
in the matter, for he thought in September that
O&#8217;Connor could never be trusted, and in November he advised
his restoration to favour. Not only was it proposed to give
him a grant of his land, but also to raise him to the peerage
as Baron of Offaly, an ancient honour in the eclipsed family
of Kildare.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
O&#8217;Tooles.</div>

<p>No tribe had hurt the Pale more than the O&#8217;Tooles, who
could boast of giving a famous saint to Irish hagiology.
Originally possessed of the southern half of Kildare, they
had been driven into the Wicklow Mountains by Walter de
Riddlesford in the early days of the Anglo-Norman occupation.
They were afterwards known as lords of Imaile, a small
district between Baltinglass and Glendalough, and at one
time held nearly all the northern half of Wicklow. The
Earls of Kildare expelled them from Powerscourt, and latterly
they had led a very precarious life. True children of
the mist, they either bivouacked in the open or crept into
wretched huts to which Englishmen hesitated to give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
name of houses. They cultivated no land, but levied 300<i>l.</i>
a year from their civilised neighbours, partly in black-rent
and partly in sheer plunder. The actual chief was Tirlogh
O&#8217;Toole, who professed himself anxious to mend his ways, and
offered to go to England and beg his lands of Henry himself.
There was something chivalrous in Tirlogh; for when Grey
was hard pressed by the northern confederacy he sent him
word that &#8216;since all those great lords were against him he
would surely be with him, but whensoever they were all at
peace, then he alone would be at war with him and the English
Pale.&#8217; This simple-minded warrior had kept his word,
and he now begged St. Leger to write to Norfolk, in the belief
that the Duke would let him want nothing &#8216;when he knew
that he had become an Englishman.&#8217; In return for his undertaking
to forego his exactions and to wear the English dress,
he asked for a grant of the district of Fercullen, comprising
Powerscourt and about twenty square miles of land, chiefly
rocks and woods, but with some fertile spots. St. Leger was
anxious to grant Tirlogh&#8217;s terms, for the lands actually held
by him were worthless and would never pay to reclaim, while
the O&#8217;Tooles were obliged to live on the Pale. The hardy
mountaineers had nothing to lose, and they prevented land
enough to support 2,000 inhabitants from being cultivated
at all. The Lord Deputy accordingly sent over the wild man
with a special recommendation to Norfolk, whose Irish experience
made him a natural mediator. Tirlogh was so poor
that St. Leger had to lend him 20<i>l.</i> for his journey, and he
could not even afford decent clothes. &#8216;It shall appear to
your Majesty,&#8217; wrote the Irish Government, &#8216;that this Tirlogh
is but a wretched person and a man of no great power,
neither having house to put his head in, nor yet money in
his purse to buy him a garment, yet may he well make 200
or 300 men.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Tirlogh
O&#8217;Toole at
Court.</div>

<p>Tirlogh remained nearly a month at Court, where he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
very well treated; perhaps Henry remembered how well
Hugh O&#8217;Donnell had requited the kindness shown to him
long since. The grant was authorised, and care was taken
to make such a fair division among the clansmen as would
prevent internal dissensions. Tirlogh became the King&#8217;s
tenant by knight-service at a rent of five marks yearly, and
his brother Art Oge, a man of some ability, was gratified
with a grant of Castle Kevin. Henry desired that this case
should form a precedent, and that in future chiefs received to
peace and favour should be treated with on the same basis as
the O&#8217;Tooles. In doing this he followed the advice of some
of his wisest councillors at home. Cranmer, Audeley, and
Sadleir did not believe in the possibility of a thorough conquest,
and rightly considered that Ireland would be best
gained by fair dealing. Pedants and flatterers might argue
that the King was actually entitled to most of the land, that
the Irish were intruders, and that grants to them were derogatory
to the royal dignity. To this it was answered that the
intrusions were of very old date, that future rebellions would
be more easily punished when they involved a breach of contract,
and that the Crown must gain by the mere acknowledgment
of its title. The O&#8217;Tooles at all events seem to
have given up plundering the Pale, and they make little further
figure in history. But they could not give up fighting
among themselves. The favoured Tirlogh had a grudge
against one of his clansmen, and pursued him daily in spite
of orders from the Government. At last the threatened man
caught his persecutor asleep, and in the early morning killed
him and all his companions; &#8216;and we think,&#8217; wrote the Lord
Deputy and Council, &#8216;the other would have done to him
likewise, if he might have gotten him at like advantage.&#8217;
Tirlogh left no legitimate children, but St. Leger nevertheless
recommended that his son Brian should be allowed to
succeed him.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Proposed
military
order.
The King
vetoes it.</div>

<p>Finding Leinster in an unusually promising state, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Irish Council hit upon a strange device for keeping it permanently
quiet. In the previous century Thomas, Earl of
Kildare, had established the Brotherhood of St. George, an
armed confraternity, whose thirteen officers, chosen from
among the loyal gentlemen of Dublin, Kildare, Meath, and
Louth, elected their own captain annually, but were paid by
the State. It was found necessary to dissolve this body by
an Act of Parliament, passed in 1494. Its object had been
the defence of the Pale against Irish enemies and English
rebels. It was now proposed to erect a new order, not named
after St. George, but holding its great ceremony on St.
George&#8217;s day. It was to consist of a Grand Master and
twelve pensioners, with salaries amounting in the aggregate
to 1,000<i>l.</i> The majority were to be Irishmen of family, who
might be kept out of mischief by fear of losing their pensions.
After seven years, promotion was to depend on knowing
English, or having spent two years in the public service
in England; the object being to induce Irish gentlemen to
cross the Channel and learn manners. As vacancies occurred
the persons chosen were to be bound &#8216;not to have any wife
or wives.&#8217; The Council nominated Brabazon to be first
Grand Master; but Ormonde put forth a list of his own, and
preferred his brother Richard to the highest place. The
Council also proposed to make a pensioner of Lord Kilcullen,
and to place him in the castle of Clonmore, which had belonged
to his family, but which the King had granted to
Ormonde. The Earl naturally ignored this claim, and there
were other differences in the rival lists. The Council suggested
elaborate machinery by which the Order might be
made to work for the reformation of Leinster; but St. Leger
does not appear to have been a party to the scheme, and
perhaps opposed it quietly. The King, who had just
abolished the great military Order, had no idea of creating
another, though its patron saint should be St. George instead
of St. John. &#8216;We do in no wise,&#8217; he said, &#8216;like any part
of your device in that behalf.&#8217; By minding their business
and doing what they were told his Majesty hoped that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
would ultimately succeed in reforming Leinster &#8216;without the
new erection of any such fantasies.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">An arrangement
is made
with
Desmond.</div>

<p>James Fitzjohn being now necessarily acknowledged Earl
of Desmond, one of St. Leger&#8217;s first cares was to obtain his
submission. Satisfied at last that no treachery was intended,
Desmond agreed to meet the Lord Deputy at Cashel. Passing
through Carlow and Kilkenny, St. Leger was joined by
Ormonde, who took care that the viceregal retinue should be
well treated on the journey; but Desmond at first held aloof,
and demanded that the chief of the Butlers should give himself
up as a hostage before he trusted himself in English
hands. This was refused; but Archbishop Browne, Travers,
the Master of the Ordnance, and the Deputy&#8217;s brother Robert
consented to run the risk. Desmond then appeared, and said
he was ready to do all that loyalty demanded. The proceedings
were adjourned to Sir Thomas Butler&#8217;s house at Cahir,
and there Desmond signed a solemn notarial instrument, by
which he fully acknowledged the King&#8217;s supremacy in Church
and State. &#8216;I do,&#8217; he said, &#8216;utterly deny and forsake the
Bishop of Rome, and his usurped primacy and authority, and
shall with all my power resist and repress the same and all
that shall by any means use and maintain the same.&#8217; He
renounced the pretensions of his family not to attend Parliament
or enter any walled town. He agreed to abide by and
to enforce the King&#8217;s decision as to the Kildare estates,
and to pay all such taxes as were paid in the territories
of Ormonde, Delvin, and other noblemen of like condition.
He constituted himself the defender of the corporate towns,
and gave up all claims to the allegiance of the Munster Englishry,
with a partial reservation as to men of his own blood,
who held their lands under him or his ancestors. Finally, he
agreed to send his son to be educated in England. This was
Gerald, the ill-starred youth whose folly and vanity were
destined to work the final ruin of his House. The Archbishop
of Cashel and the Bishops of Limerick and Emly witnessed
the instrument, and the manner of the submission was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
satisfactory as a Tudor could wish. &#8216;In presence,&#8217; wrote St.
Leger to the King, &#8216;of MacWilliam, O&#8217;Connor, and divers
other Irish gentlemen, to the number of 200 at the least, he
kneeled down before me and most humbly delivered his said
submission, desiring me to deliver unto him his said pardon,
granted by your Majesty; affirming that it was more glad to
him to be so reconciled to your favours, than to have any
worldly treasure; protesting that no earthly cause should
make him from henceforth swerve from your Majesty&#8217;s obedience.
And after that done, I delivered to him your said
most gracious pardon, which he most joyfully accepted.&#8217; He
was immediately sworn of the Council, and St. Leger asked
the King&#8217;s indulgence for having done this without warrant.
Care was also taken to prevent a renewal of the quarrel between
the new Privy Councillor and Ormonde, who had
married the heiress-general of a former Earl of Desmond, and
had thus large and indefinite claims on the family estates.
The rivals bound themselves in 4,000<i>l.</i> to promote cross-marriages
between their children, and to keep the peace.
The claims of Ormonde through his wife were nevertheless
destined in the next generation to deluge Munster in blood.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dutiful

<p>Desmond accompanied St. Leger to Kilmallock, &#8216;where, I
think, none of your Grace&#8217;s Deputies came this hundred years
before,&#8217; and treated him hospitably, openly declaring that he
was ready if the Deputy wished it to go to London to see the
King. O&#8217;Brien came peacefully to Limerick, complaining
chiefly that he was not allowed to bridge the Shannon nor to
exercise jurisdiction over friendly tribes on the left bank.
St. Leger promised him perpetual war unless he would yield
on both points, believing that he could do little harm without
the concurrence of Desmond, of the Clanricarde Burkes, or
of Donogh O&#8217;Brien. He was given till Shrovetide to consult
his friends, and at last decided to keep quiet and to send
agents to watch over his interests in Parliament. A pardon
was issued under the Great Seal of Ireland, and towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
end of the year O&#8217;Brien spontaneously addressed a very dutiful
letter to the King, begging personal as well as official
forgiveness for his many sins. &#8216;My mind,&#8217; he said, &#8216;is never
satisfied till I have made the same submission to your Grace&#8217;s
own person, whom I most desire to see above all creatures on

<div class="sidenote">MacWilliam
Burke and
MacGillapatrick.</div>

<p>MacWilliam Burke of Clanricarde and MacGillapatrick
professed anxiety for the royal favour, and accompanied St.
Leger on his tour. He prescribed an earldom for the former,
a barony for the latter, and Parliament-robes and other fine
clothes for both; in the belief that titles and little acts of
civility would weigh more with these rude men than a display
of force. He himself had given MacWilliam a silver-gilt cup,
and in Limerick Desmond had from vanity or policy worn
&#8216;gown, jacket, doublet, hose, shirts, caps, and a velvet riding
coat,&#8217; from the Lord Deputy&#8217;s wardrobe. It was very important
to conciliate MacWilliam, who could always prevent
a junction of the O&#8217;Briens and O&#8217;Donnells. MacGillapatrick
soon afterwards covenanted with the King to live civilly, to
act loyally, and to hold his lands of the Crown by knight-service.
MacWilliam wrote a letter to Henry confessing and
lamenting that his family had degenerated, and belied their
English blood, &#8216;which have been brought to Irish and disobedient
rule by reason of marriage and nurseing with those

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of 1541.</div>

<p>Early in 1541 St. Leger received authority to summon a
Parliament. The composition of the House of Commons is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
uncertain, for no list of members is extant between 1382 and
1559. In the former of those years eighteen counties or districts
and eleven towns were represented. In the latter, ten
counties and twenty-eight cities and boroughs returned two
members each. Through the action of the royal prerogative
the number was progressively increased until the 300 of the
eighteenth century was reached. In St. Leger&#8217;s time the
Upper House was the more important of the two, and was
attended by four archbishops, nineteen bishops, and twenty
temporal peers, of whom Desmond was one. Among the
temporal peers was Rawson, late prior of Kilmainham and
chief of the Irish Hospitallers, who had just been created
Viscount Clontarf. There were four new Barons&mdash;Edmund
Butler Lord Dunboyne, MacGillapatrick Lord Upper Ossory,
Oliver Plunkett Lord Louth, and William Bermingham Lord
Carbery. Richard le Poer had been created Baron of Curraghmore
six years before. Besides the peers there were
present in Dublin Donough O&#8217;Brien, MacWilliam Burke,
O&#8217;Reilly, Cahir MacArt Kavanagh, Phelim Roe O&#8217;Neill of
Clandeboye, and some of the O&#8217;Mores. O&#8217;Brien sent agents
or deputies. These and other important persons were present
at the passing of the Bill which made Henry King of Ireland;
but they had no votes and were not considered as members of
Parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry
VIII. is
made King
of Ireland.</div>

<p>Parliament met on Monday, June 13; but the Munster
lords had not yet arrived, and the solemn mass was postponed
until Thursday, the feast of Corpus Christi. By that day all
had assembled, and they rode in state to the place of meeting.
Most of the peers wore their robes. On the morrow the Commons
chose a Speaker in the person of Sir Thomas Cusack, a
rising lawyer, who afterwards obtained the highest professional
honours. He made a set speech at the bar of the Lords,
praising the King for many things, but especially for having
extirpated the Bishop of Rome&#8217;s usurped power. Ormonde
then gave the substance of what had been said in Irish, to
the &#8216;great contentation of those lords who could not understand
English.&#8217; At the sitting of the House of Lords on the
following day, St. Leger proposed that Henry VIII. should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
King of Ireland. A Bill to that effect was read a first time
in English and Irish, and was received with acclamation. It
was then and there read a second and a third time, and all
the Lords subscribed it, lest they should thereafter be tempted
to deny their consents. The Bill was then sent down to the
Commons and read three times, and on the morrow, in presence
of both Houses, St. Leger pronounced the royal consent&mdash;&#8216;no
less,&#8217; he wrote, &#8216;to my comfort, than to be risen again
from death to life, that I so poor a wretch should, by your excellent
goodness, be put to that honour, that in my time your
Majesty should most worthily have another Imperial Crown.&#8217;
This rapid action is in striking contrast to the long and acrimonious
discussion excited by a change of the royal style in
our own times.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">King and
Pope.
The royal
style.</div>

<p>The question of style was one of considerable practical
importance, for the friars had sedulously encouraged the
popular notion that the real sovereignty rested in the Pope,
and that the King of England was only a sort of viceroy.
Alen had recommended the assumption of the royal title four
years before; and both Staples and St. Leger had given the
like advice. Parliamentary sanction had now been given to
the change, and those who acknowledged English law could
hardly dispute the principle involved. In the later struggles
of Irish parties the contest between the Crown and the Tiara
was constantly revived, and the ghost of the controversy is
sometimes seen even in our own times. Less than two
months before the meeting of St. Leger&#8217;s Parliament, Paul
III. had written to prepare O&#8217;Neill for the arrival of a detachment
of the Company of Jesus, and before its dissolution the
first Jesuits had landed. But for the moment no opposition
was visible. The proclamation of the new style was joyously
celebrated by the citizens of Dublin. Salutes were fired.
Bonfires were lit. Wine casks were broached in the streets;
and there was much feasting in private houses. An amnesty
was granted to criminals, except traitors, murderers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
ravishers; but prisoners for debt were not released, lest any
creditor should be defrauded. There was some fear lest it
should be supposed that the Irish Parliament had elected
their King instead of merely declaring his just hereditary
right; and many letters were exchanged on the subject.
Finally the new style was settled as follows:&mdash;&#8216;Henry VIII.,
by the Grace of God, King of England, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, and of the Church of England, and
also of Ireland, in earth the Supreme Head.&#8217; A new Great
Seal had to be sent from England, since there was no competent
engraver in Dublin. And thus, after the lapse of nearly
four centuries, did Henry II.&#8217;s successor repudiate all obligations
to Rome, and declare himself King of Ireland by right
divine.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Regulations
for
Munster.</div>

<p>The other Acts passed had no political significance, but
followed pretty closely recent domestic legislation in England.
After a session of little more than five weeks, Parliament was
prorogued with the intention of convoking it again at Limerick.
Before the two Houses dispersed, elaborate regulations, which
were not embodied in an Act of Parliament, were drawn up
for Munster, Thomond, and Connaught. There was no chance
of enforcing these ordinances, but some of them are very
good. Laymen and minors were disabled from holding
ecclesiastical benefices; kernes were ordered to be treated
as vagabonds, unless some lord would give bail for them;
heads of families were declared responsible for damage done
by younger members. Highway robbery and rape were pronounced
capital; but by a strange anomaly robberies of above
fourteen pence were made punishable by the loss of one ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
for the first offence and of the other ear for the second, while
death was fixed as the penalty for the third. A system of
fines was promulgated for homicides, invasions, and spoils.
The Irish jurisprudence was thus acknowledged, but only as
a matter of fact, for the chiefs who indulged in open lawlessness
were generally beyond the reach of the law. Saffron
shirts were forbidden under penalties, and the permissible
quantity of linen was carefully prescribed for each rank. A
lord might have twenty cubits, his vassals eighteen, and his
servants twelve. A kerne was allowed sixteen and an agricultural
labourer ten. Stringent but useless limitations were
imposed on coyne and livery, the fact being that great men
had usually no other means of protecting their districts.
Ormonde was appointed chief executor of these ordinances
for Tipperary, Waterford, and Kilkenny, and Desmond for
the other counties of Munster. Both were to command the
assistance of the Archbishop of Cashel and to be entitled to
one-third of all fines levied by them, two-thirds being payable
to the King. The regulations for Thomond and Connaught
were the same as for Munster, but they were probably even
less regarded.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
O&#8217;Carrolls.</div>

<p>The attendance of Irishmen during the session of Parliament
was not altogether barren of immediate results. Fergananim
O&#8217;Carroll, chief of Ely, having become blind, was murdered in
Clonlisk Castle by Teige, the son of his old rival Donough,
with the help of some of the Molloys. The claimants to the
vacant succession voluntarily submitted to the arbitration of
the Lord Deputy and Council, and a curious award was given.
According to Irish law John O&#8217;Carroll, as the eldest, would
have been the natural chief. He was set aside as unfit to
rule, but received his lands rent free and forty cows annually
out of the cattle-tribute payable to the chief. Fergananim&#8217;s
son Teige was also pronounced incompetent, but was nevertheless
established as ruler of half the country by way of propitiating
Desmond, who was his uncle by marriage. Calvagh
or Charles O&#8217;Carroll was made lord of the other half, and it
was provided that if either procured the other&#8217;s death he
should forfeit all to the sons of the deceased.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Submission
of O&#8217;Donnell,
1541.</div>

<p>Soon after the prorogation St. Leger went to Cavan to
meet O&#8217;Donnell. Leaving his boats on Lough Erne, the
chieftain came boldly to the appointed place with a dozen
followers, and made little difficulty about the terms of peace.
He agreed to serve the King on all great hostings, to attend
the next Parliament or send duly authorised deputies, to hold
his land of the Crown, and to take any title that might be
given him. He not only renounced the usurped primacy and
authority of Rome, but promised industriously and diligently
to expel, eject, and root out from his country all adherents of
the Pope, or else to coerce and constrain them to submit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the King and his successors. He more than once asked to
be made Earl of Sligo, and to have Parliament-robes as well
as &#8216;that golden instrument or chain which noblemen wear on
their necks.&#8217; Henry was willing to create O&#8217;Donnell Earl of
Tyrconnell, but the creation was deferred until the reign of
James I.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Leger

O&#8217;Neills.</div>

<p>O&#8217;Neill still refused to come to Dundalk, or in any way
to submit to the Lord Deputy. He was, he said, waiting to
hear from the King, and he made the curious complaint that
St. Leger would not let him send hawks as presents to his
Majesty. Diplomacy failing, the Lord Deputy prepared for
an invasion of Ulster. He was joined by O&#8217;Donnell, O&#8217;Hanlon,
Magennis, MacMahon, who had lately made submission in
the usual form, Phelim Roe O&#8217;Neill and Neill Connelagh
O&#8217;Neill, nephews and opponents of the chief of Tyrone; by
the Savages of Ards; and by many others, both English and
Irish. Twenty-two days were spent in destroying corn and
butter; but no enemy appeared, and the cattle had been driven
off into the woods. Meanwhile O&#8217;Neill tried the bold but not
uncommon experiment of attacking the Pale in the absence
of its defenders. The new Lord Louth handled the local
force so well that the invaders were ignominiously routed,
while O&#8217;Donnell ravaged not only Tyrone but a great part of
Fermanagh, the very islands in Lough Erne being ransacked
by his flotilla.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Success of
a winter
campaign.</div>

<p>After a month&#8217;s respite St. Leger made a second raid, and
this time captured some hundreds of cows and horses. Another
month elapsed, and then a third attack brought O&#8217;Neill to his
knees. He sent letters to Armagh in which he threw himself
on the King&#8217;s mercy, which he preferred to the Lord Deputy&#8217;s,
gave a son as hostage, and offered to come in person not only
to Dundalk but to Drogheda. O&#8217;Neill had never been known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
to give a hostage before, and great importance was attached
to this. Three thousand kine besides horses and sheep were
taken in spite of the natives, but not without much suffering
on the part of the soldiers, who had to lie without tents on
the wet ground. Many horses died, and many more were
lamed. The pastime, as St. Leger called it, of a December
campaign can never be very pleasant, but he proved, as Sidney
proved afterwards, that it was the right way to subdue the
O&#8217;Neills. There was not grass enough in the woods to keep
the cattle alive, and when they came into the fields the
soldiers easily captured them.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Submission
of O&#8217;Neill.</div>

<p>Ultimately O&#8217;Neill made a complete submission. He
agreed to behave like the Earls of Ormonde and Desmond,
praying only that he might not be forced to incur the danger
and expense of attending any Parliament sitting to the west
of the Barrow. He not only renounced the Pope, but promised
to send back future bulls, if ecclesiastics already provided
from Rome would do likewise.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The

<p>The Council advised Henry to accept O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s submission,
seeing that his country was wide and difficult, and now so wasted
as to be incapable of supporting an army. It might perhaps
be possible to expel Con, but he would certainly be succeeded
by a pretender as bad as himself, and extreme courses might
lead to despair, and to a universal rebellion. They admitted
that the winter war had been proved to be &#8216;the destruction
of any Irishmen,&#8217; but the loss of men and horses was great,
and might lead to risings in other places.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry&#8217;s
ideas about
Ireland.</div>

<p>The King disliked the wholesale grants of land for small
consideration, which were favoured by St. Leger. He rebuked
his servants in Ireland for thinking too much of Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
submissions, and here he saw more clearly than they did.
He was now King in Ireland, and required a revenue in proportion.
For that purpose he divided Irishmen into two
classes, those who were within easy reach of his arm, and
those who were not. The former were to be treated sternly,
but the latter tenderly, &#8216;lest by extreme demands they should
revolt to their former beastliness.&#8217; The near neighbours were
to be brought to the same terms as Tirlogh O&#8217;Toole. A
proper rent was to be exacted, and knight-service insisted
on for the sake of the wardships and liveries. In the obedient
districts monastic lands were to be let on lease for the best
possible rent. In more distant quarters the chiefs were to be
coaxed into suppressing the religious houses by promising
them leases on easy terms.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ireland at
peace, 1542.
Submission
of many
chiefs.</div>

<p>At the beginning of the year 1542 the Council were able
to make the strange announcement that Ireland was at peace.
They praised St. Leger for his diligence, patience, and justice,
and for his liberal entertainment of those on whom, for the
public good, it was necessary to make favourable impression.
Following up his Dublin success, he now met Parliament
again at Limerick, where the principal business was to make
terms with the O&#8217;Briens. Murrough agreed to give up all
claims to the territory of Owney Beg, a poor district lying
under Slieve Phelim, which retains its reputation for turbulence
to the present day. The possession of this tract had
made him master of the western part of Limerick, whence he
exacted a black-rent of 80<i>l.</i>, and of Tipperary as far as Cashel.
The whole country was waste through plunder and extortion,
and no one could travel peaceably from Limerick to Waterford
through fear of a gang of robbers called the &#8216;old evil children,&#8217;
who held a castle near the Shannon. Desmond expelled these
brigands and handed over their hold to MacBrien Coonagh,
who held it at his own expense for two years. St. Leger&#8217;s
observations during the session at Limerick led him to believe
that little rent or tribute could be got out of the Irish. The
sums promised to Grey were withheld on the ground that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
promises had been forcibly extorted. By holding out hopes
of gentler treatment, St. Leger brought them to accept his
own much easier terms. Tipperary was assessed at 40<i>l.</i>
yearly, Kilkenny at 40<i>l.</i>, and Waterford at 10<i>l.</i> MacBrien
Arra agreed to pay sixpence a year for each ploughland, and
to furnish sixty gallowglasses for a month. MacBrien of
Coonagh promised 5<i>l.</i>, O&#8217;Kennedy and MacEgan in Ormonde
10<i>l.</i> each, O&#8217;Mulryan forty shillings and sixty gallowglasses
for a month, and O&#8217;Dwyer eightpence for each ploughland
and forty gallowglasses for a month. These sums are small,
but seem larger when we reflect that the Government gave
no consideration, either by keeping the peace or administering
justice, and that the people were extremely poor.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
submissions.</div>

<p>Several months passed in negotiations with Irish chiefs
with the general object of inducing them to submit, to pay
rent, and to hold their lands by knight-service; forswearing
Irish uses and exactions, and promising to live in a more
civilised manner. These terms were accepted by Rory O&#8217;More,
who had become chief of Leix by the death of his brother
Kedagh, by MacDonnell, captain of O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s gallowglasses,
by O&#8217;Rourke, and by O&#8217;Byrne. All except the last named
abjured the Pope, as did the MacQuillins, a family of Welsh
extraction long settled in the Route, a district between
the Bush and the Bann. The MacQuillins were always oppressed
by the O&#8217;Cahans, who were supposed to be instigated
by O&#8217;Donnell, and the valuable fishery of the Bann was a
perennial source of dissension. Travers, who soon afterwards
became lessee of Clandeboye, held this fishery on a Crown lease
with the goodwill of the MacQuillins; but in spite of the
O&#8217;Cahans, who annoyed his fishermen, St. Leger ordered him
to help the weaker tribe. Coleraine was taken by Travers,
and after a time the neighbours were reconciled, a pension of
10<i>l.</i> being given to each on condition of not molesting those
who fished under royal licence. A curious submission was
that of Hugh O&#8217;Kelly, who seems to have been chief of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
sept as well as hereditary Abbot of the Cistercians at Knockmoy,
near Tuam. He renounced the Pope, promised to aid
the Lord Deputy with a considerable force in Connaught,
and with a smaller one in more distant parts, and to bring
certain of his kinsmen to similar terms. In return he was
to have custody of the monastic lands and of the rectory of
Galway at a rent of 5<i>l.</i>, paid down yearly in that town. As
if to complete the anomaly this abbot-chieftain gave his son
as a hostage for due performance.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Desmond
in favour
at Court.</div>

<p>Desmond continued to behave loyally. St. Leger received
him hospitably in Dublin, and advised the King to do the
same. But Alen cautioned his Majesty not to be too free of
his grants, especially in such important cases as Croom and
Adare. The Chancellor preferred to give the Earl monastic
lands in the Pale, by accepting which he would give hostages
to the Crown, or among the wild Irish, who would thus certainly
be losers though the King might be no direct gainer.
Desmond did not linger long in the Court sunshine, for he
took leave of the King in little more than a month from the
date of his leaving Ireland. Either he really gained the
royal goodwill, or Henry thought it wise to take St. Leger&#8217;s
advice, for he gave him money and clothes, made him the
bearer of official despatches, and, after due inquiry, accepted
his nominee to the bishopric of Emly.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>With a view to establish order in those portions of Munster
under Desmond&#8217;s influence, St. Leger visited Cork, where
the notables readily obeyed his call. They abjured the Pope,
and agreed to refer all differences to certain named arbitrators.
Henceforth no one was to take the law into his own
hands, but to complain to Desmond and to the Bishops of
Cork, Waterford, and Ross, who were to have the power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
summoning parties and witnesses, and of fining contumacious
persons. Difficult cases were to be referred to the Lord
Deputy and Council, and legal points reserved for qualified
commissioners, whom the King was to send into Munster at
Easter and Michaelmas. This was part of a scheme for establishing
circuits in the southern province, but it was very
imperfectly carried out during this and the three succeeding
reigns. The state of the country seldom admitted of peaceful
assizes, and martial law was too often necessary. The Munster
gentry now promised to keep the peace, and to exact no
black-rents from Cork or other towns. The Anglo-Norman
element was represented by Lord Barrymore and his kinsmen,
Barry Roe and Barry Oge, by Lord Roche, and by Sir
Gerald MacShane of Dromana. The Irish parties to the contract
were MacCarthy More, MacCarthy Reagh, MacCarthy of
Muskerry, MacDonough MacCarthy of Duhallow, O&#8217;Callaghan,
and O&#8217;Sullivan Beare. St. Leger himself, Desmond, Brabazon,
Travers, and Sir Osborne Echingham, marshal of the
army, represented the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">An Earldom
for
O&#8217;Neill.</div>

<p>O&#8217;Neill was at last induced to go to Court to receive the
Earldom of Tyrone, the title chosen for him by the Irish
Government. He would have preferred that of Ulster, but it
was in the Crown, and the King refused to part with it. St.
Leger did what he could to conciliate O&#8217;Neill by attention
and hospitality while in Dublin, and rightly attached great
importance to the fact that he was the first O&#8217;Neill who had
ever gone to the King in England. He advised that he
should be received with the greatest distinction.</p>

<p>&#8216;O&#8217;Neill,&#8217; say the &#8216;Four Masters,&#8217; &#8216;that is, Con the son of
Con, went to the King of England, namely, Henry VIII.; and
the King created O&#8217;Neill an Earl, and enjoined that he should
not be called O&#8217;Neill any longer. O&#8217;Neill received great
honour from the King on this occasion.&#8217; The acceptance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
a peerage was universally considered a condescension, if not
a degradation, for the head of a family who claimed to be
princes of Ulster in spite of the Crown. The Irish Government
were willing that he should have Tyrone, &#8216;but for the
rule of Irishmen, which be at his Grace&#8217;s peace, we think
not best his Highness should grant any such thing to him
as yet.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His submission.</div>

<p>It may be doubted whether O&#8217;Neill fully understood the
scope of a document which was written in English, and
which he signed with a mark; but the form of his submission
to his &#8216;most gracious sovereign lord&#8217; was as ample as
even that sovereign lord could wish:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;Pleaseth your most Excellent Majesty, I, O&#8217;Neill, one of
your Majesty&#8217;s most humble subjects of your realm of Ireland,
do confess and acknowledge before your most Excellent Highness,
that by ignorance, and for lack of knowledge of my most
bounden duty of allegiance, I have most grievously offended
your Majesty, for the which I ask your Grace here mercy and
forgiveness, most humbly beseeching your Highness of your
most gracious pardon; refusing my name and state, which I
have usurped upon your Grace against my duty, and requiring
your Majesty of your clemency to give me what name,
state, title, land, or living it shall please your Highness,
which I shall knowledge to take and hold of your Majesty&#8217;s

<div class="sidenote">He is

<p>One week after the delivery of this submission O&#8217;Neill
was created Earl of Tyrone, with remainder to his son Matthew
in tail male: Matthew being at the same time created Baron
of Dungannon, with remainder to the eldest son of the Earl
of Tyrone for the time being. This patent afterwards gave
rise to infinite bloodshed. Con O&#8217;Neill certainly acknowledged
Matthew as his heir apparent; but it was afterwards stated,
not only that he was illegitimate, which might not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
mattered much, but that he was not Con&#8217;s son at all. There
was no doubt about the legitimacy of Shane, and that able
savage consistently refused to acknowledge the limitations
of the patent. Henry dealt liberally with the new Earl, paying
60<i>l.</i> for a gold chain such as O&#8217;Donnell had asked for,
65<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> for creation fees and robes, and 100 marks as
a present in ready money. &#8216;The Queen&#8217;s closet at Greenwich
was richly hanged with cloth of Arras, and well strewed
with rushes&#8217;&mdash;no more was then thought of even in a palace&mdash;and
Tyrone was led in by the Earls of Hertford and Oxford,
the latter of whom was summoned specially for the purpose.
Viscount Lisle bore the new Earl&#8217;s sword. Kneeling in the
rushes, the descendant of Niall of the Nine Hostages submitted
to be girt by the hands of Henry II.&#8217;s descendant. The
King then gave him his patent, and he gave thanks in Irish,
which his chaplain translated into English. Two of his neighbours,
Donnell and Arthur Magennis, were knighted and
received gifts from the King. A great dinner followed, to
which the lords went in procession with trumpets blowing;
and Tyrone carried his own patent. At second course Garter
proclaimed the King&#8217;s style and that of the new Earl. The
herald who tells the story is careful to note that Tyrone gave
twenty angels to Garter, 10<i>l.</i> to the College of Arms, and 40<i>s.</i>
to the trumpeters, with other fees &#8216;according to the old and
ancient custom.&#8217; Next day Con was taken to pay his respects
to the young Prince Edward, and he soon afterwards returned
to Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>Murrough O&#8217;Brien, his nephew Donough, MacWilliam of
Clanricarde, and many other Irish gentlemen of note, went to
Court during the summer of 1543. The three first were
raised to the peerage in the same place and with the same
ceremonies as O&#8217;Neill. Murrough O&#8217;Brien was created Earl
of Thomond, with remainder to Donough, and Baron of Inchiquin
in tail male. Donough&#8217;s right to succeed as tanist thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
received official sanction. Donough was made Baron of
Ibracken in tail male, and, curiously enough, the same patent
created him Earl of Thomond for life in case he should survive
his uncle. MacWilliam was created Earl of Clanricarde and
Baron of Dunkellin. The Earls were introduced by Derby
and Ormonde, the Barons by Clinton and Mountjoy, and the
King gave a gold chain to each. The presence of the Scottish
ambassadors, who had just concluded the abortive treaty of
marriage between Edward and Mary Stuart, added to the
interest of the ceremony; and no doubt Henry was glad to
display his magnificence to the representatives of the poor
northern kingdom. Macnamara, the most important person
in Clare after the O&#8217;Briens, was knighted at the same time;
as were O&#8217;Shaugnessy, chief of the country about Gort, and
his neighbour O&#8217;Grady. Many other favours were conferred
on these reclaimed Irishmen, and they all agreed to hold
their lands of the King.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The MacDonnells
in
Antrim.</div>

<p>The relations between England and Scotland were at this
time much strained. The miserable and mysterious death of
James V. left the northern kingdom a battle-field for contending
factions, and the restless Beaton had full scope for
his intrigues. The Hebridean settlers on the Ulster coast
had always been troublesome, since they were ever ready to
sell their swords to the highest bidder; and they now became
really important. These settlements originated with the
Bysets or Bissets, sometimes called Missets, who were said to
be of Greek origin and who accompanied the Conqueror to
England. They afterwards settled in Scotland, whence they
were expelled in 1242 on suspicion of being concerned in the
murder of an Earl of Athole, and condemned to take the
cross. Preferring Ireland to Palestine, the exiles bought the
island of Rathlin from Richard de Burgo, Earl of Ulster.
About the close of the fourteenth century, Margaret, the
heiress of the Bysets, married John More MacDonnell, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
grandson through his mother of Robert II. of Scotland. This
lady is said to have known Richard II. during his second
visit to Ireland, and to have recognised him afterwards,
crazed and a refugee, in the island of Isla. By Margaret&#8217;s
marriage the estates of the Bysets passed to the MacDonnells,
and a close intercourse was thenceforth kept up between the
Western Isles and Antrim, which are never out of sight of one
another in clear weather. Matrimonial alliances with O&#8217;Neills,
O&#8217;Donnells, and O&#8217;Cahans were frequent, and the islemen
established themselves so firmly that Rathlin was as late as
1617 claimed as part of Scotland. It has an assured place
in Scottish history; for, among the rocks of black basalt and
white chalk which give Rathlin its curious piebald look,
stand the ruins of the castle where Robert Bruce is said to
have learned the lesson of perseverance from a spider. In
Henry VIII.&#8217;s time the head of the Irish MacDonnells was
Alexander or Alaster, whose influence at Court had been
great enough to drive Argyle from the western government,
but whose common place of residence was on the shore of
Ballycastle Bay. Many other Hebrideans were settled in
Antrim, but the MacDonnells were always the leading clan.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Contemporary
description
of them.</div>

<p>John Edgar, a reforming priest of the violent kind which
Western Scotland has produced, gave Henry VIII. a graphic
account of the islemen in his day. They spent much time
in hunting and manly exercises, going barelegged and barefoot
though the snow should be waist deep, &#8216;wherefore the
tender and delicate gentlemen of Scotland call us Redshanks.&#8217;
Against exceptional frosts they protected themselves with
moccasins made of fresh red-deer hide, secured with thongs
and full of holes to let the water in and out. The hairy side
being exposed gained them the name of &#8216;rough-footed Scots,&#8217;
and the whole description recalls a well-known nursery rhyme.
The people of the Irish isles of Arran still use cowhide coverings
exactly similar, to protect their feet from the sharp lime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>stone
rocks which are too slippery for soled boots. Edgar is
careful to mention that the perones worn by the ancient
Latines in Virgil were shoes of the same kind. Travers,
who saw a great deal of the Hebrideans, was less struck by
their poetic aspect, and simply describes them as &#8216;most vile
in their living of any nation next Irishmen.&#8217; &#8216;Nevertheless,&#8217;
says Edgar, who anticipated such criticism, &#8216;when we Redshanks
come to the Court waiting on our lords and masters,
who also for velvets and silks be right well arrayed, we have
as good garments as some of our fellows which give attendance
at Court every day.&#8217; These hardy islanders were in
great request as mercenaries even in the South of Ireland,
and it was a far cry to Mull or Isla, where, and where
only, the English or Irish Government could seriously injure
them.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fears of
Scotland
and France,
1543.</div>

<p>St. Leger was uneasy lest a combined Scotch and French
attack should be made on Ireland. Two French ships in
company with some Scotch galleys were seen off Carrickfergus.
There was an English squadron off Lambay, and its appearance
had at first had a good effect, but it could not even guard the
sixty miles of water between Howth and Holyhead. Frenchmen
and Bretons frequented the Irish coast, and even sold
Spanish prizes at Cork; for that city claimed the strange
privilege of dealing with the King&#8217;s enemies in time of war.
James Delahide was in O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s country with a servant of
the Earl of Argyle, and young Gerald of Kildare might at
any moment be made the instrument of fresh disturbances.
James MacDonnell, Alaster&#8217;s eldest son, had been brought
up at the Scottish Court, and, alone of his race, had learned
to write: he was married&mdash;or perhaps only handfasted&mdash;to
Lady Agnes Campbell, Argyle&#8217;s sister, and Beaton might at
any time turn the connection to account.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Leger is
successful
in Ulster.</div>

<p>In the first flush of the matrimonial treaty Henry announced
that he would have Scotsmen treated as friends.
But against Frenchmen he had declared war, and he and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
Emperor had bound themselves not to make a separate peace.
Yet in thirteen months Charles suddenly came to terms with
Francis, leaving Henry to get his army out of France as he
best could, and to see the English coast insulted by a French
fleet. Whatever the designs of the French party in Scotland,
no invasion of Ireland in fact took place. Tyrone, O&#8217;Donnell,
and some of their neighbours were induced to visit Dublin
and to submit their differences to the Lord Deputy. There
was a standing dispute as to whether O&#8217;Dogherty, chief of
Innishowen, owed service and tribute to O&#8217;Donnell or to
O&#8217;Neill. The former established his title, but agreed to pay
sixty cows yearly if O&#8217;Neill would prevent his men from
molesting Innishowen. The contention that O&#8217;Donnell
himself owed suit and service to O&#8217;Neill was not accepted,
and both were confined to their own districts. Both made
extravagant pretensions, but their documents were worthless,
and proceeded for the most part from the imagination of
Irish bards and story tellers who would do anything for
money, or for love, or from a lively sense of favours to come.
St. Leger managed to bring about an amicable arrangement,
and even to lay the foundation of an increased revenue
in Ulster.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry&#8217;s
financial
dishonesty.</div>

<p>The reckless extravagance of Henry, his venal courtiers,
and useless wars, had sunk him in debt. The plunder of the
Church was gone, and there seemed no limit to the calls on
the generosity or fears of his subjects. A king who could
seek the help of a subservient Parliament to repudiate his
debts was not likely to be scrupulous about contract obligations,
and he seems to have contemplated resuming by Act
of Parliament all Irish lands which had been leased by his
authority. St. Leger protested in the strongest manner
against thus confiscating the improvements of tenants, who
had paid their rent and spent their money on the faith of
royal grants. Discontent was already prevalent, for the pay
of the soldiers was in arrear. Their number was reduced to
550, but they had not been paid for months, and a sum of less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
than 2,500<i>l.</i> was all that the King would send. A full pay
was impossible, and the Irish Government were afraid even to
make payments on account, lest an invasion or other sudden
emergency should find them penniless. They urged the folly
of not paying punctually, and their reasoning applies to the
frugal Elizabeth as well as to her spendthrift father. The
Tudor monarchy had already outgrown the feudal exchequer.
&#8216;We assure your Highness your affairs hath often been much
hindered in default of money, which being paid at last is no
alleviating of charge; and yet by default of monthly payments,
half the service is not done that might and should be
done. In which case if it might please your Majesty, of your
princely bounty, to furnish us for your army beforehand for
one whole year, your Highness shall perceive your affairs
thereby to be highly advanced.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Leger
leaves Ireland,
1544.</div>

<p>Like every other Deputy, St. Leger soon grew heartily
sick of Ireland. &#8216;I beseech you,&#8217; he wrote to the King, &#8216;to
remember your poor slave, that hath now been three years in
hell, absent from your Majesty, and call me again to your
presence, which is my joy in this world.&#8217; Four months after
sending this touching appeal he received leave of absence; but
he could not then be spared, and he remained in Ireland until
the beginning of 1544. Brabazon, who became Lord Justice,
remembered what had happened after Grey&#8217;s departure, and
stood well upon his guard. The veteran O&#8217;Connor and the
new Baron of Upper Ossory were discovered to be in league.
They avowed designs against O&#8217;More; but Brabazon was not
to be deceived, and preserved the peace by imprisoning the
Baron. Clanricarde enjoyed his Earldom only a few months,
and his life had not been such as to ensure a peaceful succession.
&#8216;Whether the late Earl,&#8217; the Irish Government wrote,
&#8216;hath any heir male, it is not yet known, there were so many
marriages and divorces; but no doubt he married this last
woman solemnly.&#8217; His son Richard by Maude Lacy was
ultimately acknowledged as second Earl, and became a con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>siderable

<div class="sidenote">An Irish
contingent
for the
Scotch
war, 1544.</div>

<p>Beaton had outwitted Henry, annulled the marriage treaty
from which so much had been hoped, and brought his countrymen
back to the French alliance. Breathing threatenings
and slaughter, the King of England determined to raise an
Irish contingent as his predecessors had done. As his object
was to destroy the greatest possible quantity of property, he
could hardly have done better. One thousand kerne were required
for Scotland and 2,000 for France. The order to raise
the men only reached Ireland about the beginning of March,
and Henry&#8217;s impatience expected them to be ready in a few
days. The Irish nobility were not unwilling to meet the
King&#8217;s views, but they thought six months&#8217; notice would have
been little enough. Even in England such a sudden levy
would have been very difficult, and in Ireland, the King was
reminded, &#8216;the idle men were not at such commandment, that
willingly they would in such case forthwith obey their
governor, nor gladly depart the realm, being never trained
to the thing, without some nobleman of these parts had
the conduct of them.&#8217; Great exertions were made, the Council
dividing into a northern and southern recruiting party;
but the King was at last obliged to content himself with
1,000 kerne, the proportions to be furnished by different
chiefs and noblemen being fixed by Henry himself. Ormonde,
who was asked to give 100, sent 200, and Desmond provided
120 instead of 100. The Lords Power, Cahir, and Slane also
did more than they were required; but the Irish chiefs were
all under the mark, and the O&#8217;Briens and others sent none at
all. Tyrone, O&#8217;Reilly, and O&#8217;Connor were pretty well represented,
and the deficiencies were supplied from various sources.
In Irish warfare every two kerne used to have a &#8216;page or boy,
which commonly is nevertheless a man.&#8217; That allowance was
diminished by one-half, and when all deductions had been
made, more than 1,000 fighting men were sent. The ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
which brought treasure for this expedition was chased by
the Breton rovers, who then commanded the Channel. There
was some difficulty in finding a commander, &#8216;Earls being unwieldy
men to go with light kerne,&#8217; and the choice of the
Council lay practically between Lord Power and Lord Dunboyne.
The former, who was Ormonde&#8217;s nephew, was chosen.
The Council were afraid of offending the chiefs by refusing
any quotas which might be furnished after the departure of
the main body, and they resolved to take all who came. In
any case, they said, &#8216;if any ruffle should chance, we be discharged
of so many.&#8217; They begged Henry to see that they
were properly treated for an encouragement to others. The
kerne were good soldiers in their way, but the King was
warned that they would require some training for regular
warfare. The proportion of officers was excessive; but the
Council advised their retention, lest disappointment should
quench the smoking flax of Irish loyalty.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Irish troops
at the siege
of Boulogne.</div>

<p>Lord Power&#8217;s men mustered 700 men in St. James&#8217;s
Park, the rest having been perhaps diverted to the Scottish
borders, and they served at the siege of Boulogne, burning
all the villages near the beleaguered town, and foraging
as much as thirty miles inland. Their plan was to tie a
bull to a stake and scorch him with faggots. The poor
beast&#8217;s roars attracted the cattle of the country, &#8216;all which
they would lightly lead away, and furnish the camp with
store of beef.&#8217; They treated Frenchmen no better than their
bulls, preferring their heads to any ransom. The French
sent to Henry to ask whether he had brought men or devils
with him, but he only laughed; and they retaliated by mutilating
and torturing every Irishman that they could catch.
The Irish gained a more honourable distinction from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">Apprehensions
from
France.</div>

<p>Rumours were afloat at this time about great preparations
at Brest for the invasion of Ireland in the interest of Gerald
of Kildare. It was supposed that the blow would fall in
Cork, Lady Eleanor MacCarthy not having yet been pardoned,
and her influence being very great. The Council
thought that they could resist 10,000 men with the help of
the natives, who would all stand firm against Frenchmen.
But if young Gerald once set his foot in Ireland, they could
answer for nothing. It was true that he had left Italy and
Reginald Pole, but only to serve with the Knights of Malta
against the Moslems; and it does not appear that he visited
France at all. But the very sound of his name, coupled with
Scots one day and with Frenchmen the next, kept the Irish
Government in hot water for more than a year. Lady Eleanor
received a pardon, and her nephew, who was now nineteen,
returned about the same time to Italy. From the time that
he entered Cosmo de&#8217; Medici&#8217;s service the rumours in Ireland
ceased.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Leger
returns to
Ireland.
He falls
out with
Ormonde.</div>

<p>St. Leger returned to Ireland in August 1544, after the
kerne had sailed, and it was probably their absence which
kept the island quiet for a time. Like his predecessor, St.
Leger found Ormonde&#8217;s power embarrassing. He knew him
to be loyal, and personally both liked and admired him, but
could not help being uneasy at his overgrown power. His
influence in the Council was so great that St. Leger reported
him as having &#8216;the great part of all those that daily frequent
the Council here, of his fee.&#8217; The King&#8217;s interest had small
chance against the Earl&#8217;s, &#8216;and as I am true man,&#8217; St. Leger
wrote, &#8216;I see no man having learning that will plainly speak
in such a case but poor Sir Thomas Cusack.&#8217; Ormonde now
claimed for his palatinate of Tipperary a larger meaning than
had lately been given to it. The undefined boundaries he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
stretched to the utmost, and throughout the whole district
claimed every sovereign right, except treasure trove and the
right of punishing rape, arson, and coining. Men feared to
speak openly against him. Cusack was maligned for his
independence, and Lord Upper Ossory begged St. Leger to
keep his communications secret. The palatinate jurisdiction
and the prisage of wines had been taken from the House of
Ormonde by Poyning&#8217;s Parliament; but the Earl could show
later documents under the Great Seal, some of which St.
Leger suspected to have been forged during the time that
Sir Piers Butler was Lord Deputy. St. Leger also complained
that Ormonde put obstacles in the way of reforming
Leinster, unless he might do it himself and in his own way.
He recommended that this mighty subject&#8217;s wings should be
clipped a little, and that he should have no more grants of
land in Ireland; he had no objection to the King giving him
as much as he pleased in England. To make things pleasant
he recommended a garter. After all this he strangely proposed
to entrust the Irish Government to a succession of
Irish noblemen for two or three years at a time, and to make
Ormonde the first Deputy of the new series. The suggestion
met with no favour, and seems not to have been thought
worthy of an answer. No Irish nobleman received the
sword during the remainder of the Tudor period; but when
Charles I. was slipping from the throne he committed his
interests in Ireland to the charge of another and more famous
Ormonde.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Donnell Dhu, calling himself Earl of Ross and claiming
to be Lord of the Isles, having escaped from his almost lifelong
imprisonment, was received with open arms by the
Hebrideans, who still sighed for their ancient independence.
Donnell and seventeen of his principal supporters bound
themselves solemnly to be at the command of Lennox, who
had declared for Henry VIII. against the regent Arran and
the French party, which at this time was also the Scotch
party. The confederates gave full treating powers to Rory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">and sends

<p>A few days after this treaty the bishop and the bailie
came to Dublin and asked for 1,000<i>l.</i> Half of this sum, with
100<i>l.</i> worth of provisions, was as much as St. Leger could
afford to give them. In the meantime Donnell Dhu had
appeared at Carrickfergus with 4,000 men and 180 galleys,
having left another force of 4,000 behind him to keep Argyle
and Huntley in check. In writing to the King of England
he expressed great joy that his Majesty had deigned to look
upon so small a person, and either he, or the priest who
prompted him, found an extraordinary analogy between the
fishers of the Western Isles and those of the Galilean lake,
and between Henry VIII. and their Master. At Carrickfergus
Donnell Dhu and his friends again bound themselves
to do the bidding of Lennox, and &#8216;to fortify after their power
the King&#8217;s Majesty touching the marriage of the Princess of
Scotland, and in all other affairs as is commanded them to
do by my Lord Earl of Lennox.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His agreement
with

<p>Having done their business in Dublin, Donnell&#8217;s ambassadors
hurried to England and made their terms with the
Council. They bound their chief and his friends to be
Henry&#8217;s liege subjects, and to furnish him with 8,000 auxiliaries,
who were to co-operate with Lennox and Ormonde, and,
if possible, to harry Scotland as far as Stirling. While
Lennox remained in Argyle&#8217;s country all the islemen were
to be employed in destroying it; in other places 6,000 were
to follow him, but there were never to be less than 2,000
occupied in persecuting the sons of Diarmid. In consideration
of this undertaking Henry promised to pay 3,000 of
Donnell&#8217;s men, and to send a force of 2,000 Irish under
Ormonde, who was to be subordinate to Lennox.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The whole
project
ends in
failure.</div>

<p>St. Leger had considerable difficulty in raising 2,000 men
at short notice. Money was scarce with him, and he was
not told what pay he might offer. Recruiting was hindered
by rumours of casualties among the kerne who had taken
part in Hertford&#8217;s second raid, when they had been specially
employed to burn and waste East Teviotdale &#8216;because the
borderers would not most willingly burn their neighbours.&#8217;
The required number was, however, got together by great
exertions, one-half being raised by Ormonde. The force when
complete consisted of 100 of the Dublin garrison, 400 gallowglasses,
and 1,500 kerne. Two hundred and fifty had muskets,
or were to some extent trained in the use of artillery,
of which there were several pieces. Shipping was collected
in the Irish and Welsh ports, and great quantities of munitions
put on board. Lennox himself came to Dublin, and
sailed with Ormonde for the Clyde. Dumbarton Castle was
in the hands of Lord Glencairne, and was to be taken if possible.
Should this attempt fail, the plan was to effect a
landing in Argyle&#8217;s country, and to do all the damage possible
there. The fleet left Dublin on November 17, and was
unlucky from the first, being caught in a storm off Belfast
Lough and much damaged. On reaching the Clyde the
country was found to be up in arms, the attitude of the islemen
was uncertain, a French squadron was on the coast, and
Lennox, against the advice of Ormonde, resolved to turn
back. Donnell Dhu died at Drogheda just at the critical
moment, and was buried in St. Patrick&#8217;s, Dublin, where an
epitaph recorded the mournful fact that he had escaped an
exile&#8217;s life only to die an exile&#8217;s death.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">James

<p>James MacDonnell, the son of Alaster, became Lord of
the Isles by general consent. He had been educated at the
Scottish Court, and his politics had thus lost something of
their insularity. At all events he had learned to write, and
that was a rare accomplishment for one of his family in those
days. Lady Agnes Campbell had perhaps excited doubts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
his mind as to the desirability of destroying the Argyle
power; and others in the isles may have doubted the power
of Henry VIII. to protect them against the Campbells and
Gordons. But James still professed his readiness to do
the King of England&#8217;s bidding, suggested St. Patrick&#8217;s day&mdash;nearly
two months off&mdash;for a meeting with Lennox in the
island of Sanda, and in the meantime asked for shipping to
transport his men. Ragged Scotchmen continued to flock
to Dublin, all asking for money; and the Irish Government
soon formed an opinion that while the cost of maintaining
them was certain, the expectation of service was more than
doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissensions
between St.
Leger and
Ormonde.</div>

<p>St. Leger and Ormonde were now at open war. When
leaving Gowran for Scotland the latter received an anonymous
letter warning him that he was sent there only that he
might be the more easily caught and put into the Tower.
The writer affirmed that Lennox had said as much, and that
the boasting of the Lord Deputy&#8217;s servants had been to the
same effect. The pretext was that the Earl obstructed Irish
reforms. Ormonde seems to have partly believed the letter,
for he sent a copy to Russell, and begged him to procure an
impartial inquiry. He then went to Scotland, declaring that
his loyalty was not of that timorous sort which fears inquiry
or shuns danger. &#8216;If,&#8217; he wrote, &#8216;I saw all the power of the
world upon a hill armed against his Majesty, I would rather
run to his Grace, though I were slain at his Majesty&#8217;s heels,
than to leave his Highness and save myself.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">They both
go to England,

<p>After his return from Scotland Ormonde wrote several
letters to Privy Councillors in England, in which he attacked
St. Leger&#8217;s administration as expensive and wasteful. A
graver accusation against a servant of Henry VIII. was that
he concealed much which it imported the King to know.
The letters were seized on ship-board by the Lord Deputy&#8217;s
brother, and detained for some time in Dublin. Ormonde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
refused to state his grievances before the Irish Council,
as being necessarily under St. Leger&#8217;s influence, but preferred
to run all the risks of a voyage to England. The Irish
Government left all to the Privy Council. St. Leger accordingly
went over to state his own case, having first secured
certificates of character from the Irish Council, from Desmond,
Tyrone, Thomond, and Upper Ossory, and from several Irish
chiefs, all of whom willingly came to Dublin at his summons,
and &#8216;wept and lamented the departing of so just a governor.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Intrigues
of Irish
officials.</div>

<p>Lord Chancellor Alen was not favourable to St. Leger.
He quarrelled regularly with every deputy; but there may
be some truth in his allegations, which are little more than a
statement of the insoluble problem of Irish government. The
King&#8217;s writ did not run much further than in former days.
The revenue was almost stationary, and was supplemented
annually by 5,000<i>l.</i> of English money. Leinster was not reformed.
Irishmen were quiet, but might not long remain so.
The chiefs continued to wage private war, and were not to
be tamed with abbey-lands in their own countries, or farms
in the Pale. &#8216;I cannot,&#8217; said Alen, &#8216;learn that ever such
barbarous people kept touch any while, or were ever vanquished
with fair words. Let Wales be example.&#8217; Interrogatories
were sent to Irish councillors on these and similar
points, and as to whether either St. Leger or the Chancellor
had been corrupt in any way. Questions were asked as to
the demeanour of every councillor, as to whether Alen&#8217;s
account of St. Leger&#8217;s overbearing conduct at the Council
Board was true, as to the behaviour of Ormonde and others
there. In replying to Alen&#8217;s charges, St. Leger complained
of their vagueness, and detailed his strenuous exertions to
overcome the inherent difficulties of his task, and here most
people will sympathise with him. He thought that Irishmen
on the whole kept their word as well as Englishmen, &#8216;and
if Irishmen use their own laws, so doth the Earl of Ormonde,
and all the Lords Marchers in Ireland.&#8217; We have here a line
of argument very common in our own day, but very rare in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
that of Henry VIII., and St. Leger must be credited with
unusual breadth of view. The Irish customs were in truth
necessary; for there was then no way of enforcing English
law, and the difficulty of applying it fully has not disappeared
even in the reign of Queen Victoria. As to mismanagement
of the revenue, St. Leger gave Alen the lie direct, and accused
him of conspiring with Walter Cowley to defame him; but
this the Chancellor positively denied. The Lord Deputy
begged that he might not be wearied with interrogatories, but
called before the Council, and confronted with his accusers.
&#8216;Then,&#8217; he said, &#8216;let me be rid of this hell, wherein I have
remained six years, and that some other may serve his Majesty
as long as I have done, and I to serve him elsewhere, where
he shall command me. Though the same were in Turkey, I
will not refuse it.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Leger
exonerated
from
blame.
Alen and
Cowley imprisoned.</div>

<p>The English Government came to the conclusion that St.
Leger deserved no blame. Alen could not be quite acquitted
of factious conduct; but he was a faithful servant, and hardly
to be spared from Ireland, which had the quality of transmuting
wisdom into foolishness and honesty into self-seeking.
He suffered a short imprisonment in the Tower, and had to
surrender the Great Seal, which, after being refused by two
other lawyers, was given to Sir Richard Rede. But his
property was restored to him immediately after Edward&#8217;s
accession; he became Lord Chancellor again, and received
the constableship of Maynooth, and many other favours. In
1550 he seems still to have been grumbling against St. Leger,
who could then afford to speak of him as his old friend.
Walter Cowley, the Irish Solicitor-General, was also sent to
the Tower. It appears that one William Cantwell held a
lease for life of three farms in Kilkenny, and that others had
seized them while he was learning English at Oxford. There
may have been a question of title, for it was not uncommon
in Henry VIII.&#8217;s time to grant the same property to several
people at once. Believing that he had been kept from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
own by Ormonde, St. Leger espoused Cantwell&#8217;s cause; and
it was to get the Earl out of the way that Cantwell wrote the
Gowran letter, and another found at Ross. Cowley, who was
more or less under Alen&#8217;s influence, declared in the Tower
that his report against St. Leger had been revised by the
Chancellor; but this was solemnly denied. &#8216;I was,&#8217; said Alen,
&#8216;never of counsel with article of it. God is my Judge, I
would be ashamed to be named to be privy to the penning of
so lewd a book;&#8217; and years afterwards he told Paget that
Cowley had confessed the truth of this disclaimer. Perhaps
he spoke in fear of the rack; in any case, the Privy Council
or the King decided that he was a liar, and he was certainly
a plotter like his father before him. The old man was
deprived of the office of Master of the Rolls, and the young
one of that of Solicitor-General. Both were employed again
in the next reign. St. Leger was reconciled to Ormonde, and
in spite of his prayers was restored to his government with
increased honours and an hereditary pension.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Murder of
Ormonde.</div>

<p>Ormonde never saw Ireland again. He kept fifty servants
in London, who invited him to sup with them at Limehouse.
After supper the whole company sickened, and seventeen in
all died. The Earl was carried to Ely House in Holborn,
where he lingered for several days, but at last succumbed.
There seems to have been no inquiry into this tragedy, and
one might suspect that the Government took this means of
releasing themselves from a man who had become inconveniently
powerful, and whose services were too eminent to
attack openly. Henry had no particular scruples about assassination,
when, as in Cardinal Beaton&#8217;s case, he could not reach
his enemy by other means; but he would hardly have been
likely to poison a subject against whom he could always
compass an Act of Attainder. The fact that Ormonde&#8217;s
loyalty was above suspicion may have rendered this course
difficult, and Henry may have seen in him a possible Earl
of Kildare. He was ambitious, very powerful, impatient of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
interference, and by no means tamely subservient to the ruler
of the hour. There is no reason to suppose that Hertford
or Wriothesley were capable of such a crime. Warwick was
capable of anything; but if he had suspected the Seymours,
he would hardly have allowed the matter to be hushed
up. An anecdote of Ormonde&#8217;s son, the famous tenth Earl,
perhaps points to a suspicion against Leicester&#8217;s father; but
it is not likely that the mystery will ever be cleared up. The
&#8216;Four Masters&#8217; say St. Leger had boasted that either he or
Ormonde should never return to Ireland; but this is not mentioned
by older annalists, nor in the official correspondence,
and it is just the sort of story that would have been concocted
afterwards. Ormonde&#8217;s vast estates passed quietly to his heir,
a boy of fourteen, who became the most famous and powerful
man of his age and country. The boy was educated at the
English Court, and 200 marks a year out of his lands in
Ireland were assigned for his support.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">All Deputies

Butlers and

<p>Scarcely any Deputy could escape collison with the head
of the Butler family, whose influence rested on lasting foundations
and not on the favour of the Dublin Government.
Moreover, permanent officials, who had powerful connections
in the county, knew how to thwart their nominal superior;
and, unless he happened to be a man of great tact, difficulties
were sure to arise. Grey and Bellingham quarrelled with the
Council. Sidney viewed the Ormonde of his day with unconcealed
jealousy and suspicion. Strafford was at war with
the Lord-Treasurer Cork and with the Vice-Treasurer Mountnorris;
and his treatment of the latter contributed to his fall.
Lord Fitzwilliam was beaten by a revenue commissioner,
Lord Townsend by the boroughmongers; and the lawyers
have often been able to make combinations enabling them
to dictate their own terms. Australian governors can best
appreciate the difficulties of Ireland&#8217;s rulers in past times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry&#8217;s
Irish
policy;
why it
failed.</div>

<p>Henry VIII.&#8217;s plan for the government of Ireland was very
different from that which his children pursued. Evidently he
did not desire to plant colonists in the country, but rather to
civilise the people as they were. By creating some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
great chiefs Earls, and by insisting on their going to Court
for investiture, he hoped gradually to convert them into supporters.
Such cases as that of Tirlogh O&#8217;Toole show that he
knew how to be both gracious and just. On the other hand,
the ferocity of his character was exemplified by his treatment
of the five Geraldine brethren. He was a thoroughly selfish
man, but in matters which did not concern him personally he
had many of the qualifications of a statesman. Had England
remained in communion with Rome, his tentative and patient
policy might have succeeded in Ireland. The Reformation
caused its failure, for there never was the slightest chance of
native Ireland embracing the new doctrines. The monasteries
had not weighed heavily on Ireland, and their destruction
made many bitter enemies and few friends. By upsetting
the whole ecclesiastical structure, Henry left the field clear
for Jesuits and wandering friars; and his children reaped the
fruits of a mistake which neutralised every effort to win
Ireland.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE IRISH CHURCH UNDER HENRY VIII.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">King and
Pope.</div>

<p>During the quarter of a century which elapsed between
Henry&#8217;s accession and his final breach with Rome, the King
showed great submission to the papal chair. The wishes of
such a faithful son could not be lightly regarded, and royal
nominations to English bishoprics were invariably confirmed
by the Pontiff. Capitular elections still took place; but they
had ceased to be free, and preferment was really given by the
joint fiat of the Crown and the Tiara. In Ireland the King
was less absolute. The popes had not forgotten their original
gift of the island; and the clergy, more especially in remote
regions, would naturally look to them for promotion, rather
than to a King whose power was uncertain and to whom they
had a national antipathy. In the year 1520 the united sees
of Cork and Cloyne became vacant. Surrey, then Lord-Lieutenant,
was besieged with applications, but preferred the
claims of Walter Wellesley, head of the great Augustinian
house of Conal in Kildare. In right of his priory Wellesley
had already a seat in the Irish House of Lords, and Surrey
recommended him to Wolsey as &#8216;a famous clerk, noted the best
in the land&mdash;a man of gravity and virtuous conversation and a
singular mind having to English order.&#8217; Wellesley was not
nominated on this occasion, either because he preferred his
priory to a bishopric, or because the Cardinal had other views.
In the following year the Bishop of Limerick died, and the
Lord-Lieutenant and Council again strongly recommended
the Prior of Conal; but the Pope nevertheless provided John
Quin, a Dominican friar, and Wellesley did not become a
bishop till 1529. He was then at last consecrated to Kildare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
and allowed to keep his monastery, as in that situation he
might very fairly do.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Case of
Clonfert.</div>

<p>The points at issue between King and Pope are well illustrated
by the case of Clonfert, which fell vacant at the moment
of separation. Clement provided the Dean, Roland de Burgo,
and Henry appointed Richard Nangle Provincial of the Irish
Austinfriars. Nangle was consecrated and took possession
of his see. Relying on his family influence, and probably
upheld by popular opinion, the Papal prelate, who was armed
with the power of granting indulgences and dispensations,
defied the royal nominee, and Nangle was afraid to appear in
public. It was proposed to bring the Burkes to their senses
by laying an embargo on the trade of Galway, but this does
not seem to have been done. Ten years after his original
provision, and probably after the death of Nangle, De Burgo
was confirmed by the King and allowed to hold his deanery
and other benefices, of which he had all along kept possession,
on condition of renouncing the Pope&#8217;s bulls and acknowledging
that he held from the Crown. The Bishop, who must
have had an elastic conscience, died in harness in 1580.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Armagh.</div>

<p>The more important bishoprics were generally given to
men whom the English Government could trust, and it is
not likely that they were ever filled up in defiance of the
King until after his rupture with Rome. Armagh, Dublin,
and Meath were rarely entrusted to any but men of English
birth. In 1513 John Kite, a Londoner, was appointed by
provision to Armagh, but the nomination was certainly agreeable
to Henry, who had before employed Kite as a diplomatist
in Spain. The temporalities of the diocese were almost immediately
restored to him, and he was soon afterwards present
in London at the grand reception of Wolsey&#8217;s red hat. Kite,
who received many tokens of royal favour, was translated by
the Pope to Carlisle. The Holy See claimed very full rights
in the case of a translation; but George Cromer, an English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>man,
was appointed to Armagh at the King of England&#8217;s
supplication. Such was the form preferred by the Pope, but
the supplication was in fact a nomination.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dublin.</div>

<p>William Rokeby, a Yorkshireman, was translated from
Meath to Dublin in 1512. Henry made him his chancellor,
and he also was present at the hat ceremony. After his
death a Somersetshire man, Hugh Inge, was translated by
the Pope from Meath to Dublin. There can be little doubt
that this was done with the King&#8217;s full consent, for Inge
acknowledged that he owed all to Wolsey. As a special
favour the tax on this occasion was reduced from 1,600 to
1,000 florins, on the suggestion of Campeggio, who reported
that certain noblemen had intruded into the diocesan lands
and greatly diminished the income. Inge also held the
office of chancellor, which at this time was almost invariably
given to an archbishop. When Inge died, John Alen, one of
Wolsey&#8217;s chaplains, was provided to Dublin at the King&#8217;s
instance, or supplication as the Pope called it, and immediately
received the Great Seal. Alen had been employed
by the Cardinal in the suppression of the lesser monasteries,
and had incurred great odium in that office.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Meath.</div>

<p>The see of Meath, which has the singular distinction of
having never possessed a cathedral, was from its position
of especial importance. After being successively filled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
Rokeby and Inge, it was given by the Pope, but probably at
Wolsey&#8217;s instigation, to Richard Wilson, Prior of Drax in
Yorkshire. It is remarkable that Wilson, who does not seem
ever to have resided in his see, fully acknowledged that the
Cardinal&#8217;s legatine authority extended to Ireland. This was
vehemently denied by Primate Cromer and his suffragans,
who were able to make their objections good; the whole
province of Armagh, except Meath, being situated among the
Irishry. On the resignation of Wilson, Edward Staples, a
Lincolnshire man, was provided by Clement on the King&#8217;s
nomination. He was allowed to hold St. Bartholomew&#8217;s
Hospital in London, and other benefices, along with his
bishopric, and he had a special Papal dispensation for filling
offices with incompatible duties. Staples fully embraced the
Reformation, and was a principal instrument in carrying out
the changed religious policy of the English Crown.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cashel.</div>

<p>In 1524 Edmund Butler, Prior of Athassel, a natural son
of Sir Piers Butler, was appointed by the Pope to Cashel,
and by him recommended to the King, who addressed letters
in his favour to the Irish Government. Kildare alleged that
Butler was opposed by his father, and there was certainly a
contest between them. The Archbishop&#8217;s object was to prevent
his father, as acting Earl Palatine of Tipperary, from
raising a revenue in that county, the larger part of which was
in his diocese. The citizens of Waterford complained that
his Grace used every kind of Irish extortion, and his opposition
to the palatinate jurisdiction clearly arose from no wish
to leave the people untaxed. In one respect indeed the prelate
bettered the instruction of the temporal magnates, for he
&#8216;retained Dermond Duff for his official and counsellor or
commissary, which so entertaineth the King&#8217;s people by colour
of canon law that there can be no more extortion committed
by any Irish Brehon, and polleth the King&#8217;s subjects as he
lists, and taketh for fee of sentence of a divorce 10<i>l.</i> or more.&#8217;
He openly robbed a boat laden with merchandise, and held
the owners to ransom. Butler&#8217;s consecration was delayed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
three years: it is not easy to say why, as there is no trace of
a dispute between the Crown and the Pope. Ultimately he
became a very important person, and generally acted with the
other Butlers in support of the King&#8217;s authority. He accepted
the royal supremacy, and surrendered his monastery when
called on to do so.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Tuam.</div>

<p>The western province was so entirely Irish that the King
could hardly have interfered effectually with Papal nominees.
On the death of the learned Maurice O&#8217;Fiehely in 1513, Thomas
O&#8217;Mullally was provided to Tuam, and lived unmolested by
Henry till 1536. But Christopher Bodkin, who had been
preferred to Kilmacduagh at the King&#8217;s request, was translated
purely by royal authority to Tuam. The breach with
Rome had at this time become irreparable; and Bodkin, whom
the Vatican regards as a schismatic but not as a heretic, acknowledged
the royal supremacy and held the temporalities
of both his sees, as well as the minor ones of Enaghdune and
Mayo, until his death in 1572. His astuteness far exceeded
that of the Vicar of Bray, for he seems to have kept his preferments
and his opinions as well. A rival archbishop was
appointed by Clement in 1538, and is now considered the
true one by writers on the Papal side. The double line has
continued ever since.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Remoter
sees.</div>

<p>To the less important and more distant bishoprics appointments
were probably very often made by the popes without
the King&#8217;s interference, and even without his notice. But
when he did make a recommendation it is hardly likely to
have been neglected at Rome. Thus the sees of Clonmacnoise,
Clogher, Ardagh, and Kilmore were on particular occasions
filled by the King, and the appointments confirmed by the
Pope at his request. The case of Clogher is the more remarkable
in that a provision of Julius II. had lately declared
that church to be immediately subject to the Holy See. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
the yet more remote districts of Down, Dromore, Raphoe, and
Derry, the King does not seem to have interfered at all. In
providing Edmund O&#8217;Gallagher to the see of Raphoe, Clement
VII. observed that the diocese was vacant because the King
had neglected to nominate any one for seventeen years.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Leinster.</div>

<p>In Leinster the King must generally have had power to
prevent any bishop from enjoying the profits of his see. The
patronage was very laxly managed, for Kildare lay vacant
from 1513 to 1526. In 1523 the Earl of Kildare tried to
get the preferment for the dean, Edward Dillon, whom he recommended
to Wolsey as of virtuous living and of English
name and condition. The application failed, but Thomas
Dillon was at last appointed both by King and Pope. This
promotion was probably effected in Kildare&#8217;s interest; for
Cowley, a partisan of the Butlers, called Dillon an Irish vagabond,
without learning, manners, or other good quality, and
not fit to be a holy water clerk. This Irish vagabond had,
however, been educated at Oxford. Thomas Halsey was persuaded
by Wolsey to accept the bishopric of Leighlin, and
Maurice Doran was, at the King&#8217;s request, provided to the
same see. There may be no positive evidence as to Ossory
and Ferns, but there is no reason to doubt that the persons
appointed were acceptable to the Government.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Munster.</div>

<p>In Munster it is not likely that bishops would be appointed
without the consent of the Crown, except perhaps to the remote
sees of Killaloe and Kilfenora, in which the succession
at this period is almost hopelessly confused. In filling the
scarcely less completely Irish bishopric of Ross, the King took
a direct part. He called upon the Pope to accept the resignation
of Edmund Courcey, and to appoint as his successor
the Cistercian John O&#8217;Murrilly, with leave to hold the Abbey
of Maur in addition. Leo X. complied in every particular;
but when O&#8217;Murrilly died two years later, the Pope took the
strong step of uniting Ross with Dromore in the distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
north. We may infer from this that Henry did not always
choose to interfere, but that when he did the Pope paid the
greatest attention to his wishes; and that this rule applied to
Munster generally. At Waterford and Cork, the strongholds
of English law, it was hardly possible for a bishop to enjoy
his revenues in defiance of the Government.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Connaught.</div>

<p>In Connaught the popes seem to have provided bishops as
a general rule; but they generally avoided a collision when
the King&#8217;s wish was openly expressed. As late as 1533
Christopher Bodkin was appointed to Kilmacduagh at Henry&#8217;s
request; and this is a very strong case, because a purely
papal nominee seems to have resigned in his favour. In
Elphin John Max was appointed by the Pope; but as he held
the abbeys of Welbeck or Tichfield, or both, along with his
bishopric, he can hardly have been distasteful to Henry. The
case of Burke and Nangle, already mentioned, shows King and
Pope openly at variance. But even at the beginning of that
contest the schism was almost complete.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bad state of
the Irish
Church.</div>

<p>In the &#8216;Description of Ireland,&#8217; written early in Henry
VIII.&#8217;s reign, there is a story of St. Brigid, who inquired of
her good angel of what Christian land most souls were
damned. He showed her a land in the west part of the
world, where was continually root of hate and envy, and vices
contrary to charity, for lack of which souls kept continually
falling down into hell as thick as hail showers. It is inferred
that the angel spoke of Ireland, &#8216;for,&#8217; says the writer, &#8216;there
is no land in this world of so long continual war within
himself, nor of so great shedding of Christian blood, nor of
so great robbing, spoiling, preying, and burning, nor of so
great wrongful extortion continually as Ireland.&#8217; Among the
various causes of this state of things the bishops and clergy
are blamed, &#8216;for there is no archbishop nor bishop, abbot nor
prior, parson nor vicar, nor any other person of the Church,
high or low, great or small, English or Irish, that useth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
preach the Word of God saveing the poor friars&#8217; beggars ...
Also the Church of this land use not to learn any other
science but the law of Canon, for covetyce of lucre transitory;
all other science whereof grows none such lucre, the parsons
of the Church doth despise. They hold more by the plough
rustical than by lucre of the plough celestial, to which they
have stretched their hands, and look always backwards. They
tend much more to lucre of that plough, whereof groweth
slander and rebuke, than to lucre of the souls, that is the
plough of Christ. And to the transitory lucre of that rustical
plough they tender so much, that little or nought there
chargeth to lucre to Christ, the souls of their subjects, of
whom they bear the cure, by preaching and teaching of the
Word of God, and by their good ensample giveing; which is
the plough of worship and of honour, and the plough of grace
that ever shall endure.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">State of
Ardagh,
Ross, Clonmacnoise,
and Enaghdune.</div>

<p>This is a heavy indictment, but it is sustained by very
many facts which have come down to us. The state of many
important churches shows how ill religion was supported. A
report to Leo X. on Ardagh Cathedral states that there was
no sacristy, no bell nor belfry, no proper appliances for service;
and that the walls of the church itself were but just standing.
There was only one altar, which was exposed to the weather.
Mass was rarely celebrated, and then by a single priest, and
the scanty vestments and utensils were kept in a chest in the
church. The town consisted of four thatched cabins; and
there were few inhabitants, owing to continual wars caused by
the conduct of the late Bishop, William O&#8217;Ferrall, who had
excited the animosity of his neighbours by attempting to exercise
temporal power. The bishopric of Ross was in rather
better case. The town of 200 houses was walled, and the
cathedral church was built of stone in regular cruciform
fashion, and with a tiled roof. There was decent provision
for the mass. On the other hand, the church was unpaved,
and the income of the see no more than sixty marks. At
Clonmacnoise, one of the most famous ecclesiastical places in
Ireland, things were scarcely better than at Ardagh. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
town could boast but twelve houses, built of wicker and straw.
The church was roofless, and half ruined; with a single altar
protected by a thatched shed, one vestment, and a cross made
of brass. Mass was rarely celebrated, but the body of St.
Ciaran was preserved and reverenced. The Pope&#8217;s informant
was an Irishman, but the saint&#8217;s name was unknown to him.
The ancient see of Enaghdune or Annaghdown on Lough
Corrib was in a deplorable state. The church was in ruins,
the clergy far out of order, and the revenue not more than
20<i>l.</i>, which could only be collected by a steward who had the
favour of the country.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Corruption
among dignitaries.</div>

<p>The above cases are all of bishoprics situated in remote parts
among the Irishry. The state of the Church in the Pale and
other obedient districts was of course better, but even in
Dublin the metropolitan crozier remained in pawn for eighty
years, from 1449 until Archbishop Alen redeemed it by paying
one hundred ounces of silver. The clergy were charged with
seeking money more than souls; and many acts of violence
and extortion are reported on oath against the Archbishop of
Cashel and the Bishops of Ferns, Ossory, Leighlin, Waterford,
and Limerick; against the Abbots of Tintern, Jerpoint, Kilcooley,
Holy Cross, Dusk, and Innislonagh; against the Priors
of Kilclogan, Knocktopher, Inistiogue, Kells, Cahir, and Lady
Abbey; and against the Prioress of Moylagh. In general
bishops and heads of houses were not less extortionate than
other gentlemen. They exacted coyne and livery and the
other multifarious Irish imposts with neither more nor less
severity than the laity. But it should not be forgotten that
these ecclesiastical dignitaries were also great landowners,
and that they were forced to provide the means of defence in
the only possible way. The Archbishop of Cashel and the
Bishops of Waterford and Ossory had other means of taxing
the people peculiar to their offices; they took excessive fees
in all matrimonial and probate cases, and appropriated a
portion of every dead man&#8217;s goods. The Archbishop&#8217;s lowest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
charge for a divorce was 5<i>l.</i>, and it was generally double that
or more. The citizens of Waterford declared that the canonists
were as burdensome as the Irish Brehons.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parochial
clergy no
better.</div>

<p>The parochial clergy were no better than the dignitaries.
They made charges varying from sixpence to two shillings
for all weddings, christenings, churchings, and burials; and at
the death of any married person, man or wife, they exacted
five shillings, or one-fifth of the personalty, or the best article
of apparel, from the survivor. In many places divine service
was neglected or was only performed at irregular intervals.
The Earl of Kildare, who was not impartial but who probably
spoke truly, declared that the churches in Tipperary and Kilkenny
were generally in ruins through the system of Papal
provisions, &#8216;so as, and if the King&#8217;s Grace do not see for the
hasty remedy of the same, there is like to be no more Christianity
there, than in the midst of Turkey.&#8217; Henry was just
beginning to quarrel with the Pope, and would be ready
enough to believe that provisions had ruined the churches.
No doubt many bad appointments were thus made, but it
may have been impossible to get fit men; for Browne reports
the clergy as unlearned persons, who repeated the Latin offices
like parrots and without understanding them.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Evils of
Papal
patronage.</div>

<p>Piers, Earl of Ossory, also adopted the doctrine that the
Papal system of patronage had been the chief cause of the
utter ruin and destruction &#8216;of cathedral churches, monasteries,
parish churches, and all other regular and secular.&#8217; Murderers,
thieves, and &#8216;light men of war&#8217; obtained provisions, ousted
the rightful incumbents, ignored the rightful patrons, held
livings by force, and wasted them in riotous living. Violence
indeed was the rule. John Purcell, Bishop of Ferns, was in
close alliance with the dangerous rebel and freebooter, Cahir
MacArt Kavanagh, was present when his men sacked the
town of Fethard, and himself called loudly for fire to burn
the houses. Milo Baron, Bishop of Ossory, was said to be as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
bad as the Bishop of Ferns, and to &#8216;have no virtuous quality nor
obedience to any good laws.&#8217; Archbishop Butler was accused
of riotous conduct and of at least one highway robbery, a
richly laden boat having been plundered by him on the Suir
within four miles of Waterford. Amid the general corruption
a bright example was shown by the Franciscan Maurice
Doran, Bishop of Leighlin, a learned theologian, an eloquent
preacher, and a man of blameless life. Being advised to
increase the burdens of his clergy, he replied that he had
rather shear his sheep than flay them. Doran was allowed to
tend his flock for twenty months only. Having corrected the
irregularities of his Archdeacon Maurice Kavanagh, he was
treacherously murdered by him. It is some satisfaction to
know that Kildare afterwards caught the Archdeacon and his
accomplices, and hanged them in chains on the scene of the
Bishop&#8217;s murder.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Regulars
not
exempt
from
censure.</div>

<p>The Regulars by no means escaped censure. The Prior of
the Hospitallers of Kilclogan in Wexford was as bad as Bishop
Purcell, and &#8216;kept fire in the steeple door of St. John&#8217;s, until
such time as he had out the ward that was within.&#8217; James
Butler, Cistercian Abbot of Innislonagh and Dean of Lismore,
attained a bad eminence. The citizens of Waterford represented
him as a man of odious life, who neglected every duty,
gave himself up to voluptuosity, and wasted the property of
his house to provide for his open and scandalous immoralities.
The people of Clonmel repeat the charge, and extend it to the
other monks. The Augustinian Canons, in the great monastery
of Athassel, of which Archbishop Butler was Prior, were
no better. Nor were the mendicants blameless. The Carmelite
Prior of Lady Abbey, near Clonmel, which was a parish
church, kept a mistress and provided no divine service. The
Prior of Knocktopher, also a Carmelite, and the Cistercian
Abbot of Dusk, had sons. That secular priests should be
fathers of families was of course common both in England and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Ireland; and they may be defended on the ground that they
were really married, and that such unions, though condemned
by the Church, were not repugnant to the public feeling of
the age. But this can hardly be pleaded in favour of monks,
and perhaps still less of friars. The Prior of Cahir neglected
divine service, but was not accused of immorality. Many
enormous crimes were objected against the Abbess of Kilclehin.
The canons of St. Catherine&#8217;s at Waterford had fallen
out among themselves, and divided the revenues. All these
houses were in south-eastern Ireland, but from what has
been said of the state of cathedral churches in Irish districts
it may be inferred that proportional irregularities existed
elsewhere. The fact that priests were often the sons of priests
rests upon less partial evidence than that of Bale, and it was
condoned by the Holy See. Leo X. even showed special
favour to a monk of Monasterevan, notwithstanding that he
was a priest&#8217;s son. Dispensations on account of defective birth
are very common in the Papal correspondence, and were a
source of income to the Curia. Archbishop Browne believed
that in the Irishry not one parson in five was of legitimate
birth. He cannot be considered impartial, but legitimacy
was little regarded by the Irish.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The good
side of the
monastic
system.</div>

<p>That some monks were immoral or useless is doubtless
true. There were critics who represented them as in every
way worse than their English brethren, but some of these
were men who desired the destruction of the abbeys that they
might divide their lands, and whose indignation had not been
excited by abuses until the wishes of the English Court were
known. Robert Cowley, for instance, accused them generally
of loose living and of &#8216;keeping no hospitality save to themselves.&#8217;
There is ample evidence that the monks were not all
bad. The education of children was almost entirely in their
hands. Six houses in Dublin, Kildare, and Kilkenny are
mentioned as the only places where the rising generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
might be brought up in virtue, learning, and good behaviour.
The boys were cared for by the Cistercians of St. Mary&#8217;s,
Dublin, and of Jerpoint, and by the Augustinian canons of
Christ Church, Dublin, and of Kells and Conal. The girls
were brought up by the canonesses of Gracedieu, near Swords.
St. Mary&#8217;s was also noted for its hospitality, being the only
inn fit for men of rank; and the doors of Christ Church were
always open for Parliament, Council, or Conference. To
escape dissolution all the monks of these houses were ready to
don secular habits. As to the services of the friars in holding
stations, in visiting the sick, and in preaching, there can
be no doubt whatever. Religion in Ireland was in fact only
maintained by them. Most of the friaries had been founded
or beautified by great families, who still continued to befriend
them, and who reserved a last resting-place within their walls.
The Franciscans were especially favoured in this way. Thus,
the MacDonnells of Antrim were buried at Bunamargy, the
Desmonds at Youghal and Tralee, the O&#8217;Briens at Ennis, the
O&#8217;Donnells at Donegal, the Macnamaras at Quin, the Burkes
at Athenry, and the MacCarthies at Irrelagh or Muckross.
The Franciscan dress was often assumed in death and burial,
and was thought to bespeak the favours of heaven. The
Dominicans were planted and cherished in the same way.
The Augustinian hermits and the Carmelites had many
houses, but were much less important than the other two
orders.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of 1536.</div>

<p>When the Irish Parliament met for the despatch of business
in May 1536 many important bills passed without any great
difficulty. The proctors of the clergy, who had voices and
claimed votes in the Lower House, objected to the King being
declared supreme head of the Church; but their opposition
was little regarded. Appeals to Rome were forbidden, the
jurisdiction of the Pope abolished, and first-fruits vested in
the Crown. Grey then prorogued Parliament, first to Kilkenny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
and afterwards to Dublin again. In the meantime Archbishop
Browne had landed, and lost no time in recommending the
royal supremacy to the people. He had but little success,
and incurred some personal danger. Primate Cromer, who
was in communication with Rome, took the other side, laying
a curse on all who should accept the new system, and reminding
his clergy that Ireland was the Pope&#8217;s gift to England.
Browne is said to have made a speech to Parliament, in which
he appealed to the example of Christ, who paid tribute to
Cæsar, and of the earliest popes, who acknowledged the
supremacy of emperors and kings. A bill was then brought
in for the suppression of twelve religious houses, and for giving
the King a twentieth of all ecclesiastical revenues. A formidable
opposition at once arose in both houses, and particularly
in the Commons under the leadership of the King&#8217;s
sergeant, Sir Patrick Barnewall, who declared openly that the
King&#8217;s supremacy gave him power to reform abbeys but not to
secularise them. He then went to England to lay his views
before Henry, and Parliament was again prorogued for nearly
four months.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Reformation
makes no
progress.</div>

<p>After eighteen months residence in Ireland Browne could
report scarcely any progress. The new Head of the Church,
by the mouth of his Archbishop, gave the people orders for
their spiritual conduct; but they were not well received. All
true Christian subjects were ordered to repudiate the Bishop
of Rome, and to erase him from their service-books and
manuals; but this was never done unless Browne sent his
own servants to see to it. The power of binding and loosing
and the system of indulgences were called juggling, and the
people were reminded that God only could forgive sins.
There was no Mediator but Christ, and the so-called Pope&#8217;s
&#8216;great thunderclap of excommunication&#8217; could hurt nobody.
These exhortations were in vain, while a conditional general
indulgence was eagerly taken advantage of. A copy of the
paper was even hung up openly in Kilmainham Church. Pilgrimages
to Rome were never commoner, and bishops and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
priors appointed by provision were received with open arms.
The circular which spoke so contemptuously of the Holy See
was Browne&#8217;s composition, but it inculcated at least two
doctrines which all modern Protestants reject&mdash;the invocation
of the Virgin and prayers for the dead.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Troubles of
Archbishop
Browne.</div>

<p>Lord Deputy Grey was opposed to doctrinal changes, and
made no secret of his dislike to Browne, whom he suspected
of traducing him. The Archbishop had little help from other
officials, and the lawyers opposed him strongly. Lord Butler,
Brabazon, Alen, and one or two others of small importance,
constituted the whole innovating party. They arrogated to
themselves the title of Catholic; they were the right Christians,
and their opponents were sectaries. But Browne&#8217;s antagonists
were active and numerous. The Observants took the
lead everywhere, and they relied on the support of Grey to
defy the Archbishop&#8217;s authority. Browne had imprisoned one
of his own prebendaries. &#8216;Howbeit, spite of my beard, whiles
that I was at an house of Observants, to swear them, and also
to extinct that name among them, my Lord Deputy hath set
him at liberty. I think the simplest holy water clerk is
better esteemed than I am.&#8217; Most of the clergy were unwilling
to acknowledge the royal supremacy, or to denounce the
Pope&#8217;s authority, and they refused to preach at all. The
most active preachers now contented themselves with holding
forth in corners to select knots of sympathisers, and took no
notice either of threats or exhortations. The oath of supremacy
had as much effect as oaths taken under pressure
usually have. Now and then some bold spirit would openly
defy Browne. James Humfrey, the prebendary whom he imprisoned
and Grey released, officiated at High Mass in St.
Andrew&#8217;s Church, and omitted to read the Archbishop&#8217;s circular.
The parish priest ascended the pulpit, and began to
read the paper; but Humfrey gave a signal to the choir, and
the reader&#8217;s voice was drowned by those of the singers.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

agree with
Bishop
Staples.</div>

<p>By the admission of so zealous a reformer as Brabazon,
Staples promoted the Word of God; but the effect of his
eloquence was much lessened by the ill-feeling existing between
him and the Archbishop. A report of one of Browne&#8217;s
sermons, which, as he alleged, was fabricated by Humfrey,
had so excited the wrath of Staples that he denounced it from
the pulpit. The Archbishop himself was present, and thought
&#8216;the three-mouthed Cerberus of hell could not have uttered it
more viperiously.&#8217; The scene was in the church of Kilmainham,
which was an exempt jurisdiction under the sole charge
of Rawson the Prior. Browne also accused Staples of indulging
in other &#8216;rabulous revilings&#8217; against him, of denying
that men should search the Scriptures, and of allowing his
suffragan to pray first for the Pope, then for the Emperor,
and lastly for the King, in the words, &#8216;I pray God he never
depart this world, until that he hath made amends.&#8217; Browne
imprisoned the suffragan, whom Grey seems to have released
without trial. Staples, on the other hand, reported that
everyone was weary of the Archbishop&#8217;s demeanour, and
that he himself had never said a word against the King&#8217;s
supremacy, or in favour of the Pope. After an inquiry by
Paynswick, Prior of Christ Church, and two others, the quarrel
was patched up; but the relations existing between the two
chief supporters of the Reformation were not at all conducive
to its success.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord

<p>It was bad enough to be called a heretic by the Bishop
of Meath, but worse to be called a poll-shorn knave friar by
a Lord Deputy who had soldiers and prisons. Browne said
it was no safer to speak against Papal usurpations before Grey
than if the Pope had been present. Lord Butler agreed with
the Archbishop that Grey had a special zeal for popery,
allowed the new system to be openly impugned in his presence,
and in fact headed the reactionary party. According to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
Browne, he went so far as to maintain a bishop appointed
by the Pope against the King&#8217;s nominee; but this is scarcely
credible. Grey, however, had the Corporation of Limerick,
and the Bishop and clergy there solemnly sworn to maintain
the new order, and renounce the usurpations of Rome. He
is said to have burned Down Cathedral, and defaced the tombs
of the three saints there; and he was accused on his trial of
turning the church into a stable, of pulling down the tower,
and of sending the famous peal of bells to England: &#8216;had not
God of His justice prevented his iniquity by sinking the vessel
and passengers wherein the said bells should have been conveyed.&#8217;
Grey has himself recorded his proceedings at the
Franciscan friary of Killeigh, whence he carried off the organ,
the glass windows, and other valuable things. On the other
hand, he spared Armagh; and, being at Trim shortly before
the destruction of the miraculous Virgin there, &#8216;very devoutly
knelt before the idol, and heard three or four masses.&#8217; This
may have been done from devotional feeling, or through sheer
inconsistency, or to annoy Browne, Brabazon, and Alen, who
were present, and who refused to enter the chapel, by way of
showing an example to the people.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Images,
relics, and

<p>Browne had a conscientious hatred to images, which he
called idols, and destroyed them wherever he could. In this
case coming events had cast their shadow before, and he at
one time thought it prudent to disclaim iconoclasm. &#8216;There

Irishmen, that I intend to pluck down our Lady of Trim,
with other places of pilgrimages, as the Holy Cross, and such
like, which indeed I never attempted, although my conscience
would right well serve me to oppress such idols.&#8217; Even more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
celebrated than the miraculous Virgin was the crozier with
which St. Patrick had banished the snakes, and which had
been brought from Armagh to Dublin. This wonder-working
staff was said to have been delivered by Christ Himself to a
hermit in a Mediterranean island, with directions to take it
to Ireland, and hand it over to the saint. It was compared
to the rod of Moses, and was the chief of a large tribe of
croziers upon which people swore in preference to the gospels.
The staff was burned publicly, and so was the Virgin of
Trim, and a crucifix of peculiar sanctity kept at Ballibogan
in Westmeath. The holy cross of Tipperary was probably
spared for a time. Browne and his successors nearly put an
end to relics, which are now so scarce that a learned member
of Parliament in our own times is said to have imported the
bones of a more or less authentic foreign saint. But it was
beyond the power of Government to put down pilgrimages,
which were numerous down to the present century. Of the
holy places still remaining, Croagh Patrick in Mayo is probably
the most remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Conformity
of Munster
Bishops.</div>

<p>When the four Protestant members of Council&mdash;Browne,
Brabazon, Alen, and Aylmer&mdash;visited Clonmel early in 1539,
two archbishops and eight bishops took the oath of supremacy
before them. The archbishops were Butler of Cashel and
Bodkin of Tuam&mdash;the first regularly appointed, the second
not acknowledged at Rome, but both in undisputed possession.
Of the eight bishops, Milo Baron or Fitzgerald of
Ossory, Nicholas Comyn of Waterford and Lismore, John
Coyne or Quin of Limerick, Thomas Hurley of Emly,
Matthew Sanders of Leighlin, and James O&#8217;Corrin of Killaloe,
appear to have been regularly appointed. The submission
of O&#8217;Corrin seems to have been resented at Rome; for
a Papal administrator was appointed to oust him eighteen
months afterwards. He found it necessary to make his peace,
and his resignation in 1542 was accepted by the Pope. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
attempt was made to displace Baron, Comyn, Quin, Hurley,
or Sanders. The remaining prelates present at Clonmel were
probably Dominick Tirrey of Cork and Cloyne, and Richard
Nangle of Clonfert. Tirrey was the King&#8217;s nominee, and
continued to hold the temporalities till his decease in 1556.
Lewis Macnamara, a Franciscan, was set up against him at
Rome, but he soon died, and the Pope did not again interfere
for a long time. Nangle, being kept out of Clonfert by his
rival, whom Grey was accused of favouring, at this time acted
as Browne&#8217;s suffragan or coadjutor. It is expressly stated
that all the Bishops of Munster were present at Clonmel, and
all have been mentioned but three. Ross was vacant, and
probably Kilfenora. Young James Fitzmaurice, who had been
lately provided to Ardfert, may have kept away in Kerry,
or very probably he was not in Ireland at all. We must
guard against hastily supposing that all, or even any, of these
prelates were Protestants. Like Gardiner, Bonner, and
Tunstal, they accepted the formulation of the old English
principle of national independence, but they had not therefore
necessarily any sympathy with the doctrines of Luther.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pope
makes
Wauchop
Primate.</div>

<p>Primate Cromer opposed the royal supremacy, but he was
none the less accused of heresy at Rome, and Robert Wauchop,
a priest of St. Andrews, was appointed to administer
the see until the Archbishop should purge himself. Wauchop
was a noted theologian, and, in spite of his imperfect
sight, had the singular reputation of riding post better than
any man in Europe. He had lived chiefly at Rome, and
was employed by the Holy See on many missions, including
attendance at the diets of Worms, Ratisbon, and Spires.
The choice of a purblind man to persuade the sharp-eyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
Germans gave rise to a proverb, and the reputation for
riding post may have been gained by the rapidity with which
he went from place to place. After Cromer&#8217;s death Wauchop
received the pall, and bore the title of Primate at the Council
of Trent, where he attended for eleven sessions, and where
he shared with the Archbishop of Upsala the distinction of
having never seen his church. In the meantime George
Dowdall was appointed by the King on St. Leger&#8217;s recommendation,
and it must be supposed that he took the oath
of supremacy. In spite of Dowdall&#8217;s zeal against the reformed
doctrines, he was never acknowledged by the Pope
until after Wauchop&#8217;s death. The latter does not appear to
have landed in Ireland, and his bolts were shot from Scotland
or France. When preparing at last in 1551 to visit
his diocese, he met a most edifying death in the Jesuit Church
at Paris.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Jesuits
sent to
Ireland,
1542.</div>

<p>It was by Wauchop&#8217;s advice that the disciples of Loyola
began their work in Ireland. Paul III. addressed a brief to
Con O&#8217;Neill, as prince of the Irish of Ulster, acknowledging
the receipt of letters which he had sent to Rome by the
hands of Raymond O&#8217;Gallagher, &#8216;by which letters,&#8217; wrote the
Pope, &#8216;and by his fuller verbal communications, our mind
has been variously affected; for we have learned with the
pain it calls for how that island is cruelly ravaged by the
present King, and to what a pitch of impiety he has brought
it, and with what savage ferocity he has spurned the honour
of God Almighty. But when, on the other hand, we learned
from thy letters and Raymond&#8217;s words that there existed in
thy person a champion of God, and of the Roman Church
and of the Catholic religion, we rejoiced greatly in the
heavenly Father&#8217;s love. We praise thee then, beloved son,
as thou hast deserved, and commend thee in the Lord; and
we give Him thanks for granting thee to us and endowing
thee with such virtue and piety for the preservation of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
island at the present time, and we pray Him long to prosper
thee, and to preserve thee to us unchanged. We have taken
such care as we were bound, and as thou hast asked us
to take for thee and for the other champions of the Catholic
Faith. We therefore exhort your lordship, and all the peoples
of Ireland who follow your authority and piety, to preserve
you all as becomes faithful servants of the True Christ,
in the Catholic Faith which you have received from your
fathers, and preserved with the greatest constancy to this
day. For we who embrace that island with singular affection
and desire to preserve it in its ancient attachment to
the Holy Faith, will never be wanting to your lordship or to
your followers in piety.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first
Jesuit missionaries.</div>

<p>John Codure and Alphonso Salmeron were selected by
the Pope as nuncios to Ireland, and another brief was sent
to the clergy of Ireland exhorting them to receive the Jesuits
with honour and goodwill. Codure died before he could visit
Ireland, and Paschal Broet accompanied Salmeron in his
stead. Francesco Zapata, not yet admitted to the society,
was their secretary. Broet, whom Loyola called the angel
of his society, was a native of Picardy. Salmeron was a
Spaniard, and one of the original seven companions who took
the momentous vow upon the hill of Montmartre. Ignatius
himself gave directions to the mission:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loyola&#8217;s instructions
to them.</div>

<p>1. They were to use caution in talking, especially with
inferiors and equals, to &#8216;take each man&#8217;s censure but reserve
their judgment.&#8217; When they could not avoid expressing an
opinion, it was to be delivered briefly and with a careless air,
so as to avoid further argument.</p>

<p>2. They were to be all things to all men, like St. Paul.
An angry man was to be treated with great circumspection.</p>

<p>3. The precept of Basilius was to be observed, that the
devil must be fought with his own weapons. To gain favour
at first they were to praise virtues rather than denounce vices.
Medicine might then by degrees be administered. Morose
men might be won by cheerfulness.</p>

<p>4. In public and private, and especially when performing
the duty of peacemakers, they were to remember that &#8216;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
their words and deeds might become known, and that the
things done in darkness would be brought to light.&#8217;</p>

<p>5. Appointments were to be anticipated rather than
deferred, so that there might be plenty of time for the business
in hand.</p>

<p>6. In money matters they were to meddle as little as
possible. Even the fines which they took for dispensations
should be given in alms by the hands of others, so that they
might be able to swear that they had not touched one
penny.</p>

<p>7. Paschal was to be chief speaker in dealing with great
men. In doubtful cases there was to be a consultation, and
the opinion of two was to bind the other.</p>

<p>8. They were to correspond with Rome frequently on
their journey, immediately on their arrival either in Ireland
or Scotland, and at least once a month afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Their adventures
in
Scotland
and Ireland.</div>

<p>After narrowly escaping imprisonment in France, the
three emissaries reached Scotland and saw James V., who
gave them a commendatory letter to the Irish nobility and a
special one to O&#8217;Neill, whom he exhorted so to receive the
strangers that they might feel the advantage of his introduction.
A brother of Bishop Farquharson of the Isles accompanied
them to Ireland, where they found nothing to their
liking, either civil or ecclesiastical. The people were savage
and the clergy negligent, and neither bishoprics nor parishes
were properly served. All the chiefs but one were not only
sworn to the royal supremacy, but had declared their readiness
to burn the Pope&#8217;s letters and to deliver his messengers
bound to the King or his Deputy. The single exception was
about to follow the general example. The Irish chiefs were
all afraid to confer with the nuncios, or even to secure them
a safe passage out of the island. The Jesuits also complained
that the Scottish King had not performed his promises. But
if Paschal and his companions could do nothing with the
chiefs, they were successful with the people. They changed
their place of abode constantly, exhorting men everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
in private, hearing confessions, and celebrating the Mass as
often as possible. Indulgences were sparingly granted, but
they gained goodwill by varying burdensome vows, and by
remitting fines and dues. Their personal virtue was evident;
they never spared themselves, and they asked for nothing.
Any money that came within their reach they diverted
through the debtor himself, or through the bishop, to such
good work as the repair of churches, the relief of widows,
and the care of unprotected girls. After thirty-four days
thus spent the pursuit waxed too hot. Rewards were offered
for their apprehension, and they escaped to Scotland, where
they vainly hoped to find a quieter people. The Scotch
chiefs seemed as bad as the Irish, and the foreigners were
fain to sail to Dieppe, whence they reached Paris on foot.
Zapata remained there for study, and the two Jesuits pursued
their journey to Rome in rags, and almost penniless.
They were arrested as spies at Lyons, but rescued by Cardinals
Tournon and Gaddi, who were passing through and who
recognised them. Thus, in apparent, but only apparent,
failure ended the first descent of the Jesuits upon Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The royal
supremacy
opposed by
the friars.</div>

<p>In the days of Henry VIII. the majority of Irish chiefs
seem to have cared greatly for land, much less, but still a
great deal, for titles and gold chains, and very little for religion.
They were, therefore, ready enough to accept the
King&#8217;s ecclesiastical polity; the rather that they hoped to
go on exactly as they had done before. But with the people
it was different. It was not for their interest that tribal
lands should be turned into private estates, nor could they
hope for special marks of royal favour. They were barbarous,
but they could appreciate virtue, and in the austere self-denial
of some friars they could discern glimmerings of a
higher light. Against the friars Henry had no available
weapon; they could not even be prevented from preaching.
Under the very shadow of Dublin Castle the King could give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
no peace to his reformed Church, of which the only sincere
supporters were a few new comers from England. Except
Browne and Staples, who, as we have seen, did not agree,
there was no one to preach what Henry wished the people to
learn. And neither of them could speak a word of Irish.
The lawyers in Dublin heard and disliked the expounders of
the new ideas, but the great mass of the population did not
even hear them. The friars had it all their own way, and
every feeling, national and sentimental, predisposed the Irish
to believe their statement of the case. The people were told
that Ireland was a fief of the Holy See, and that the vassal had
forfeited all by treason to his sovereign lord. The Defender
of the Faith had become its assailant, and he was manifestly
no longer a Catholic. These were the arguments used daily
and never answered. &#8216;In the Irishry,&#8217; Staples reported, &#8216;the
common voice runneth that the supremacy of our sovereign
lord is maintained only by power, and not reasoned by learning.&#8217;
He recommended that all Irish clerks should have
safe-conduct to come and go, and to dispute with himself.
&#8216;I trust then,&#8217; he added, perhaps with a side cut at the Archbishop,
&#8216;to do my master good service, without railing or
&#8220;frasing,&#8221; which doth well nowhere, but least in a good
cause.&#8217; And he strongly urged the assumption of the royal
title, as at least one means to disabuse the popular mind.
In the meantime the counter reformation had begun. The
official Church was to be defended mainly by power, by a
few English-speaking ecclesiastics, and by the self-seekers
who sought preferment where the sceptre was strong enough
to protect them. On the side of Rome was ranged every
popular feeling and prejudice, and it was to have the support
of crowds of devoted men who could exhort the people in
their own tongue, and whose example was sometimes more
eloquent than their words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Irish view
of Henry&#8217;s
innovations.</div>

<p>The &#8216;Four Masters&#8217; describe Henry&#8217;s reformation as &#8216;a
heresy and new error in England, through pride, vain-glory,
avarice, and lust, and through many strange sciences, so that
the men of England went into opposition to the Pope and to
Rome. They at the same time adopted various opinions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
the old law of Moses, and they styled the King the chief head
of the Church of God in his own kingdom. New laws were
enacted by the King and Council according to their own
will. They destroyed the orders to whom worldly possessions
were allowed ... and the four poor orders ...;
and the lordships and livings of all these were taken up for
the King. They broke down the monasteries, and sold their
roofs and bells, so that from Arran of the Saints to the Straits
of Dover there was not one monastery that was not broken
and shattered, with the exception of a few in Ireland, of
which the English took no heed. They afterwards burned
the images, shrines, and relics of the saints of Ireland and
England.... They also appointed archbishops and sub-bishops
for themselves; and though great was the persecution
of the Roman emperors against the Church, scarcely had
there ever come so great a persecution from Rome as this;
so that it is impossible to narrate or tell its description,
unless it should be narrated by one who saw it.&#8217; There can be
no doubt that these were the ideas prevalent in Ireland in the
sixteenth century, and they remain essentially unchanged in
the nineteenth. That the annalists tell but a small part of
the whole truth must be plain to candid students; but it is
the only part which the native Irish have ever accepted. In
England Anglicanism was the outcome of national independence;
in Ireland it was the badge of conquest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The King
resolves to
dissolve the
religious
houses.</div>

<p>Barnewall&#8217;s mission failed; but he did not lose the
King&#8217;s favour, and was soon promoted: had he been an English
lawyer he would have lost his head. While denying the
King&#8217;s right to dissolve monasteries, he made no objection to
receiving a grant of their lands, and accepted that very
nunnery of Gracedieu where all the young ladies of the Pale
had been educated. When the houses met again the clergy
opposed all legislation, being perhaps excited by rumours of a
Geraldine restoration. The proctors insisted on their right
to vote as an estate, and the bishops and abbots, who formed
a majority in the Lords, declined to entertain any business
until the point was decided. The Council gave a decided
opinion that the claim of the proctors was unfounded, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
the spiritual peers at last agreed to proceed to business with
or without their consent. The Lords threw out the Bill for
confirming the King&#8217;s title to certain abbeys, most of which
had already been suppressed; making an exception only in
the case of St. Wolstan&#8217;s. The Bill for giving the King a
twentieth part of all spiritualities was also rejected. After
a further prorogation for four months this resistance was at
length overcome. An Act was passed declaring the proctors
to be no members of Parliament, the first-fruits of abbeys were
given to the King, the suppressions were confirmed, the much
desired twentieth was granted, and the questions of faculties
and testamentary dispositions were arranged in a sense hostile
to Rome. As far as an Act of Parliament could do it, the
Church in Ireland was now placed on the same footing as
the Church in England.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">First

Relative
strength of
different
orders.</div>

<p>The first Irish religious house dissolved by Henry VIII.
seems to have been the nunnery of Grane, which gave a title
to Lord Leonard Grey; but the nuns were quartered on other
houses: this was in 1535. In the latter half of 1536 a commission
under the Great Seal not now extant was issued for
the suppression of eight Irish abbeys named therein. The
earliest victim of the batch was probably St. Wolstan&#8217;s near
Leixlip, a house of canons of the congregation of St. Victor,
which was granted to John Alen, the Master of the Rolls.
The necessary inquiries into the condition and property of
the doomed institutions were too slow for Henry, who chided
the Irish Council for remissness. They promised to proceed
as speedily as was consistent with his Highness&#8217;s profit.
Before the end of 1537 fifteen more houses had fallen, all
within the Pale or in the immediate neighbourhood of walled
towns. After this the process of surveying and suppressing
went on rapidly, so that by 1541 all, or very nearly all, the
houses in Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Louth, Carlow, Kilkenny,
Wexford, Tipperary, Waterford, and Limerick city had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
surrendered. A careful calculation makes the whole number
about seventy-eight, of which thirty-eight were Canons
Regular, eleven Crutched Friars, fifteen Hospitallers, two
Benedictines, and twelve Cistercians. Only ten of the number
were nunneries, all belonging to Regular Canonesses. To
these may be added a few in other districts, such as Aghmacarte
in MacGillapatrick&#8217;s country, and Midleton in the
county of Cork.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cistercians.
Mellifont.</div>

<p>Some monasteries deserve particular mention, and of these
Mellifont, the oldest of the Cistercian houses, is perhaps the
most famous. It is said to have contained 140 monks, and
was called Monastermore, or the Great Monastery. The Cistercians
were introduced about 1142 by Donough O&#8217;Carroll,
Prince of Oriel, at the instance of Malachy, the friend of
Bernard of Clairvaux, who wrote his life and in whose arms
he died. St. Bernard supplied the new foundation with
monks from his own monastery, under the leadership of
Christian O&#8217;Conarchy, afterwards Bishop of Lismore and
papal legate, who presided in that synod of Cashel where the
Irish Church was first formally subjected both to Rome and
to England. King John afterwards confirmed all grants
made before the conquest, and several later sovereigns were
benefactors of Mellifont. The abbot was always summoned
to Parliament, where he took precedence of all his mitred
brethren, and ranked immediately below the bishops. The
buildings, of which there are still some remains, are said to
have greatly resembled those of Clairvaux. The rich estates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
were granted by Elizabeth to Lord Drogheda&#8217;s ancestor as a
reward for defending the northern border of the Pale against
the Ulster Irish.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Holy Cross.</div>

<p>Another famous Cistercian abbey was that of Holy Cross
on the Suir, whose beautiful ruins recall, though they do not
rival, Fountains, Furness, and Rivaulx. This monastery was
founded by Donald O&#8217;Brien, King of Limerick, shortly before
the Anglo-Norman invasion. A fragment of the true cross
preserved here attracted many pilgrims, and is thought by
some to have been contained in a richly sculptured shrine
which still stands. Long after the dissolution pilgrimages
continued, and Sir Henry Sidney noted the &#8216;detestable idolatry
used to an idol called the Holy Cross, whereunto there is no
small confluence of people daily resorting.&#8217; The abbots had
seats in Parliament, and from the extent of their territorial
power were sometimes called Earls.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dunbrody
and
Tintern.</div>

<p>Two Cistercian abbeys near one another in Wexford are
remarkable from the circumstances of their foundations.
Dunbrody was built by the ruthless conqueror, Hervey de
Montmorenci, who sought to expiate his cruelties by becoming
its abbot and endowing it with all his property. Tintern
was founded in fulfilment of a vow made during a storm at
sea by William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, who brought
monks and a name from Wales. Tintern was the only Irish
abbey which retained the original black dress of Citeaux,
thus acknowledging the foundation of Stephen Harding
rather than that of Bernard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hospitallers.
Kilmainham.</div>

<p>Strongbow founded a preceptory for Templars at Kilmainham
in 1174, and it became rich and powerful. Under
Edward II. the order was suppressed in Ireland with as little
pretence of justice as elsewhere, and its possessions granted to
the Hospitallers, who showed less charity to the really poor,
though their doors were always open to strangers and travellers
of importance. The priors of Kilmainham were often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
chosen from the greatest families&mdash;Talbots, Butlers, and
Fitzgeralds&mdash;were always summoned to Parliament, and became
very important personages. Being exempt from episcopal
jurisdiction they sometimes acted almost like independent
princes. In 1444 the Prior, Thomas Fitzgerald, espoused
the cause of Archbishop Talbot in his quarrel with the White
Earl of Ormonde, and he challenged the latter to trial by
combat. The fight was appointed to take place at Smithfield,
and both champions were kept in close custody; the Earl
being confined in the Tower, of which the Duke of Exeter,
inventor of the rack and other gentle instruments, was then
constable. The Duke was authorised to allow his distinguished
prisoner exercise enough to keep him in good fighting condition,
his swordsmanship being evidently thought adequate.
The representative of the Church militant was considered
wanting in skill, and was detained in the city to receive
instructions at the royal expense from Philip Treherne, fishmonger
and fencing master. Ormonde&#8217;s friends cleared his
character, and the combat never took place. Many acts of
turbulence were charged against Fitzgerald; but he was far
outstripped by James Keating, who became prior in 1461,
and who defied the King, the Deputy, and his own Grand
Master for thirty years. Marmaduke Lumley was sent to
supersede him, but died of the ill-treatment which he received.
In 1511 Sir John Rawson, the last prior, was appointed. He
was an able man and a chief supporter of the Government,
but did not think it necessary to observe his vow of chastity.
At the dissolution Rawson was created Viscount of Clontarf,
where there was a cell of his house, and enjoyed a pension of
500 marks till his death in Edward VI.&#8217;s time. Sir William
Weston, the English Provincial, was less fortunate, for he was
forced to leave his priory and died the same day. The great
possessions of Kilmainham were granted to different persons,
and the site of the commandery is now fitly occupied by a
military hospital, which owes its foundation to the great Duke
of Ormonde.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pensions
to monks.</div>

<p>Pensions were generally granted to the heads of the dissolved
houses and sometimes to the other monks. Thus the
Abbot of Mellifont received 40<i>l.</i>, and several of the monks
from 3<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> The Prior of Fower in Westmeath
and the Abbot of St. Mary&#8217;s, Dublin, received each 50<i>l.</i>; the
Prior of St. Thomas&#8217;s, Dublin, 42<i>l.</i>; and others were paid in
proportion to the importance of their convents. In a few
cases priors received as little as 3<i>l.</i>, and monks as little as
13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> The ejected brethren often got other preferment.
Edmond O&#8217;Lonergan, Prior of Cahir, who received a pension
of 3<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, was made vicar of the parish, and William
Walsh, Prior of Ballydrohid, had a pension of 6<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> till
he should receive a benefice of greater value. Hugh Doyne,
one of the monks of Conal, who had received a pension of 40<i>s.</i>,
surrendered it on being presented by the Crown to a vicarage.
Pensions were charged on the lands of the dissolved houses,
and power of distress was sometimes given. The absence of
complaints may justify a supposition that payments were
pretty regularly made. Great numbers of monks doubtless
withdrew to the Continent. Mary herself grumbled at the
numerous pensions payable to clerks, and directed her Deputy
to make them the first objects of his patronage, so that the
pensions might be gradually absorbed.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Titular
abbots
still appointed.
Cistercians.</div>

<p>In the case of the Cistercians at least titular abbots were
sometimes appointed for many generations. Alemand, the
French historian of Irish monasteries, says that the learned
Nicholas Fagan, Bishop of Waterford, was Abbot of Innislonagh,
and was buried in the abbey in 1617. According to
the same author, who wrote towards the end of the seventeenth
century, there were in his time Abbots of Mellifont, Tintern,
and Boyle, living in the neighbourhood of their abbeys, but
dressing like laymen. They were probably chiefly occupied
in receiving novices for education in foreign convents. An
important paper drawn up at Waterford in 1646 bears the
signature of one prior of Augustinian canons, and of four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Cistercian abbots, to say nothing of Jesuits and mendicants,
but some of these may have been appointed after the breaking
out of the rebellion. In the reign of James I. some Cistercians
certainly lurked in Ireland. The nuncio Rinuccini, who
had the charge of Irish patronage from 1645, apologised for
preferring so many regulars on the ground that men of family
seldom became secular priests.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The dissolution
not
carried out
in remote
districts.</div>

<p>In 1541 a commission was issued to the Earl of Desmond
and others to survey and dissolve all religious houses in Cork,
Limerick, Kerry, and Desmond. In these districts and in the
purely Irish regions of Connaught and Ulster, the process of
dissolution was slow and uncertain. The title of the Crown
was theoretically acknowledged, but in some cases nothing was
done for many years. As the native nobility were subdued
or reconciled, Henry VIII.&#8217;s policy was gradually carried out.
In the wildest parts of Ulster the consummation was delayed
until after the flight of the Earls in the reign of James I.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Number
and wealth
of religious
foundations.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Many are
losers by
the dissolution.</div>

<p>Without counting the mendicant orders, about 350 religious
houses can be traced in Ireland. Many of these had
disappeared before the reign of Henry VIII., having become
parish churches, or been absorbed in episcopal establishments.
Others were dependent on English foundations, and were
destroyed by the Act of Absentees; others, again, were cells
to more important houses, and followed their fortunes. A
yearly income of 32,000<i>l.</i>, with personalty to the amount of
100,000<i>l.</i>, has been attributed to the Irish monasteries, and
their possessions must certainly have been considerable. The
monks, and especially the Cistercians, generally chose fertile
situations near a river or on the coast, for the sake of fish and
water carriage. The most beautiful and convenient sites were
in their hands, and their system of cultivation was much
superior to that of lay proprietors. The ceaseless wars of
Ireland did not entirely spare the religious houses, but they
escaped better than other kinds of property. The spoiling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
the Church could never have been considered a great or
glorious work. The wealth of the monks is not to be
measured by the extent of their lands. It is in the vast
number of their houses, orchards, gardens, fishing-weirs, and
mills, that we must seek the evidence of accumulated capital.
The immense circuit of the walls at Kells or Athassel seems
to show that great numbers of artificers and labourers were
sheltered within the enclosures, and that the monks knew
how to defend their own. The system of corrodies or resident
pensions probably reconciled the great nobles, and opposition
to the dissolution came partly from those who were impoverished
by their abolition. It is to these pensions, which
were perhaps often abused, that Cowley probably alludes when
he accuses the monks generally of immorality and of showing
no hospitality save to themselves and &#8216;certain bell-wedders,
which ringleaders have good fees, fat, profitable farms, the
finding of their children, with other daily pleasures of the
abbeys, and fearing to lose the profit thereof, repugn and
resist the suppressing of abbeys, surmising it should be prejudicial
to the common weal, which is otherwise.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Friaries
suppressed.
Not before
1541.</div>

<p>In 1541 a commission was issued to Sir Anthony St. Leger
and others to survey and suppress all the friaries in Ireland.
The total number was rather under two hundred, of which the
Franciscans had more than half, the Dominicans forty-three,
the Augustinian hermits twenty-four, and the Carmelites
twenty-one. As in the case of the older monasteries, the
houses within reach were at once dissolved, and the rest were
perforce respited. Their possessions were not large, and the
friars managed to exist without them. The Dominican historian
says there were about six hundred members of his
order in Ireland just before Cromwell&#8217;s conquest, and the
Franciscans were probably much more numerous. The houses
of Grey Friars had been very generally reformed by the Observants,
and it is with these stricter votaries that we generally
meet. They swarmed everywhere, and to them is due the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
preservation of the Roman tradition until the Jesuits made
head in Ireland. Archbishop Browne is never tired of testifying
against them, and Thomas Agard, his enthusiastic
supporter, calls them crafty bloodsuckers. Almost the only
open opposition to the dissolution came from a Franciscan,
Dr. Sall, who boldly preached against it at Waterford.
During the Cromwellian war and subsequent persecution the
Franciscans claim thirty-one martyrs, which shows that they
must have been very numerous. In 1645 the Carmelites
reckoned twenty-seven houses in Ireland, but most of these
were doubtless desecrated and deserted. No candid Protestant
can altogether sympathise with Browne and Agard, for we
have the most overwhelming proof that but for the friars a
large part of the population would have been altogether debarred
from the exercise of religion.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">All kinds
of men
share the
plunder.</div>

<p>Most of the men who had been useful in carrying out the
suppression received a share of the spoils. Brabazon, St.
Leger, Sir John Alen, Chief Justice Luttrell, Edmund Sexton,
Sir Thomas Cusack, and Robert Dillon, were all enriched in
this way. Prime-serjeant Barnewall denied the King&#8217;s right
to dissolve the monasteries, but profited largely by the
measure. Celts, Normans, and Saxons, Papists and Protestants
alike, showed a fine appetite for the confiscated lands.
Desmond had a lease of part of St. Mary Abbey, perhaps to
induce him to spend some of his time in Dublin. Three at
least of the new peerages&mdash;Upper Ossory, Carbery, and Cahir,
were partially endowed from similar sources. Edward Power,
bastard brother of the first baron of Curraghmore, was granted
the possession of Mothel, of which he had been prior. In
some cases, as in Clanricarde and Thomond, the Government
made a virtue of necessity, and gave monastic lands to lords
or chiefs who would have had the power to seize them in any
case. It is scarcely necessary to say that the House of Ormonde
profited enormously by the dissolution. Sometimes
the plunder was too small to excite much cupidity, and then
the monks might be spared. Thus the Austinfriars of Dun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>more
in Galway, who had &#8216;neither land nor profit, but only
the small devotion of the people,&#8217; were respited during the
King&#8217;s pleasure, on condition of assuming a secular habit. A
like indulgence was given to the canons of Toem in Tipperary,
which the O&#8217;Meaghers had been able to prevent the Royal
Commissioners from visiting. Many houses were reasonably
granted to the founders&#8217; kin, for the dissolution must have
been a heavy loss to some families. Most of the corporate
towns had founded or fostered monasteries, and Waterford,
Drogheda, Kilkenny, Galway, Limerick, Clonmel, and
Athenry received a portion of the spoils. All Saints was
specially granted to the citizens of Dublin in compensation
of their loss during the Geraldine siege. As a general rule,
monastic lands were at first let only on lease, and in succeeding
reigns large fines were obtained by the Crown. At the
first threat of dissolution some houses hastened to let their
lands for long terms, and to cut down their woods and sell
their jewels, and thus the plunder actually realised often fell
below expectation. I have met with but one case of a
charitable foundation being laid immediately upon the ruins
of a monastery, and that was owing to private liberality.
Henry Walshe, son of a Waterford merchant, bought the
Grey Friars from the King, and founded a hospital for sixty
or more sick persons. This institution received a royal charter,
and still exists on a reduced scale.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">No university
in
Ireland.</div>

<p>No care was taken to supply the place of the monasteries
which were devoted to education. There had been three
attempts to found a university in Ireland before the reign of
Henry VIII. In 1310 John Lech, Archbishop of Dublin,
obtained a bull from Clement V., who ordered the establishment
of the desired institution, which would, he hoped,
&#8216;sprinkle the said land, like a watered garden, to the exaltation
of the Catholic faith, the honour of the mother church,
and the profit of all the faithful.&#8217; Lech died soon after, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
his project was buried with him; but his successor, Alexander
de Bicknor, actually made a foundation in connection with St.
Patrick&#8217;s Cathedral, and under the patronage of John XXII.
Bicknor&#8217;s University maintained a very precarious existence
till the time of Henry VII., when it finally disappears. The
institution was not crushed by the weight of its endowments,
for it does not seem to have had any. In 1465 Bicknor&#8217;s work
was ignored by the Parliament of Drogheda, which founded a
new university on the ground that there was none in Ireland.
But it was not enough to declare that Drogheda should be as
Oxford: there was no endowment and no popular support,
and this scheme also failed. Very near the end of his
reign Henry VIII. made up his mind that one cathedral was
enough for Dublin, and he suppressed St. Patrick&#8217;s. Christ
Church had already been acknowledged as the metropolitan
church. But it was not till the next reign that Archbishop
Browne propounded his abortive plan for restoring the University
which had once faintly glimmered.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Archbishop
Browne.</div>

<p>The principal instrument by which Henry carried out his
ecclesiastical revolution was George Browne, Provincial of the
English Austinfriars, who was appointed Archbishop of Dublin
in 1535 after regular election by the two chapters. He
was consecrated by Cranmer, Fisher, and Shaxton of Salisbury,
who were significantly commanded to invest him with the pall.
Browne&#8217;s appointment is ignored at Rome, but no rival prelate
was at first set up. He had already distinguished himself
by preaching strongly against the invocation of saints, and,
whatever his faults were, he was certainly a sincere Protestant.
&#8216;The common voice goeth,&#8217; said Staples, who had not quite
made up his own mind, &#8216;that he doth abhor the Mass.&#8217;
Browne was married, but whether before or after his consecration
does not appear. He zealously promoted the King&#8217;s
supremacy and the destruction of images, and complained
bitterly of being thwarted by his colleague of Armagh, by
the Irish generally, and even by Lord Deputy Grey. Cromer
was in communication with Rome, and circulated a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
Papal oath of allegiance among the clergy, in which obedience
to heretical powers was denounced and all their acts declared
null and void. The old jealousy between Armagh and Dublin
may have had something to say to this; for Browne, if we
may believe Staples, claimed authority over all the clergy of
Ireland. The new Archbishop did not bear himself meekly
in his great office, and he received a stinging rebuke, which
the writer was pleased to call a gentle advertisement, from the
King himself. Henry accused his nominee of neglecting the
instruction of the people and the interests of the Crown.
&#8216;Such,&#8217; he added, &#8216;is your lightness in behaviour and such is
the elation of your mind in pride, that glorying in foolish
ceremonies, and delighting in <em>we</em> and <em>us</em>, in your dreams
comparing yourself so near to a prince in honour and estimation,
that all virtue and honesty is almost banished from
you. Reform yourself therefore ... and let it sink into
your remembrance that we be as able for the not doing thereof
to remove you again and to put another man of more virtue
and honesty in your place, both for our discharge against God,
and for the comfort of our good subjects there, as we were at
the beginning to prefer you.&#8217; Well might Browne answer
that the King&#8217;s letter made him tremble in body for fear. He
defended himself at length, and invoked the fate of Korah
should he fail to advance the King&#8217;s service. His defence
seems to have satisfied Henry, but he continued to make
many enemies and to excite much criticism. &#8216;His pride and
arrogance,&#8217; said Staples, &#8216;hath ravished him from the right
remembrance of himself.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bishop
Staples.</div>

<p>Edward Staples, originally a Cambridge man, and afterwards
parson of Tamworth and a canon of Cardinal College,
was appointed to the see of Meath in 1530 by Papal provision.
Either as Bishop or Privy Councillor he incurred the hatred
of the Geraldine faction, and fled to England on the breaking
out of the rebellion in 1534. Early next year he returned,
and was one of the commissioners for suppressing the nunnery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
of Grane. Staples did not at first fully embrace the reformed
doctrines, for he accused the Archbishop of Dublin of heresy,
and appears to have been attached to the Mass; but he was
as zealous as Browne for the royal supremacy, and his conversion
to thorough Protestantism was gradual like Cranmer&#8217;s.
Staples was a noted preacher, and was promoted for that
reason; but the King at one time accused him of slackness
and threatened to remove him.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">FROM THE ACCESSION OF EDWARD VI. TO THE YEAR 1551.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Accession
of Edward
VI.
Ormonde
and Desmond.</div>

<p>The death of Henry VIII. made no immediate difference to
Ireland, for St. Leger continued to govern as before. There
was such a tendency to depress the Ormonde interest that
the widowed countess thought it wise to go to London, where
she pleaded her own cause with much success. She was
supposed to have designs upon the heir of Desmond&#8217;s hand,
and the English statesmen, who naturally dreaded such an
alliance, encouraged her to marry Sir Francis Bryan, who was
in favour with Somerset as he had been with Henry VIII.
The new government directed their attention to economy and
the repression of jobbery among the Dublin officials. It was
discovered that many who drew the King&#8217;s pay were serving
in the houses of councillors, &#8216;some in the place of a cook,
some of a butler, housekeeper, and other like,&#8217; so that they
were practically useless when called to arms. This was
strictly forbidden for the future. The Irish Council were
earnestly charged finally to put down &#8216;that intolerable extortion,
coyne and livery, having always respect to some recompense
to be given to the lords and governors of our countries
for the defending of the same.&#8217; Desmond was thanked for
his services, and the young king offered to have his eldest
son brought up as his companion, &#8216;as other noblemen&#8217;s sons
whom we favour are educated with us in learning and other
virtuous qualities, whereby hereafter, when we come to just
age, we, in remembrance of our childhood spent together,
may the rather be moved to prosecute them with our wonted
favour, and they all inclined to love and serve us the more
faithfully. We shall consent and right glad to have him
with us, and shall so cherish him as ye shall have cause to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
thank us, and at his return to think the time of his attendance
on us to be well employed.&#8217; If this offer had been
accepted, and if the same results had followed as in the cases
of the young Earl of Ormonde and of Barnaby Fitzpatrick,
the unspeakable miseries of the Desmond rebellion might have
been avoided.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
bastard
Geraldines.</div>

<p>The Pale was at this time much disturbed by the depredations
of a gang of freebooters, headed by some of the bastard
Geraldines who had lost their lands. They overran the
southern half of Kildare and the northern half of Carlow,
plundering and burning Rathangan, Ballymore Eustace, and
Rathvilly. At first they acted with O&#8217;Connor, but he was
forced to go to Connaught to look for reinforcements, and the
MacGeohegans and others were induced by St. Leger to kill
his men and drive his cattle. The Fitzgeralds, after defying
the Government for a year, were crushed at Blessington in
the autumn of 1547. The O&#8217;Tooles sided with the English,
and thus justified Henry VIII.&#8217;s policy towards them. The
Irish generally fell away from O&#8217;Connor and O&#8217;More, to
whom they feared to give food and shelter; and the chiefs were
obliged to make such a peace as was possible with the Government.
The annalists dwell strongly on the strength of the
English at this time, on the unexampled bondage in which
they held the southern half of Ireland, and on their complete
victory over the man who had been &#8216;the head of the happiness
and prosperity of that half of Ireland in which he lived,
namely, Brian O&#8217;Connor.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bellingham&#8217;s
first
visit to
Ireland,
1547.</div>

<p>Sir Edward Bellingham, a gentleman of the bedchamber,
was sent over for the first time in the summer of 1547, in
charge of reinforcements. This able soldier had been Governor
of the Isle of Wight, and had served at Boulogne in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
1546. He had also held diplomatic appointments in Hungary,
and at the Emperor&#8217;s Court. The Privy Council, who
expressed themselves satisfied of his military ability, directed
the Irish Government to be guided by his advice, and to pay
him the unusual salary of forty shillings sterling a day. He
was employed by the borderers of the Pale against the
O&#8217;Mores and O&#8217;Connors, and seems to have made his mark
from the first. After a short stay Bellingham with difficulty
obtained leave to return to England. He must have succeeded
in impressing his views on Somerset, to whose religious
party he belonged, for St. Leger was recalled in the
following spring, and Bellingham was appointed in his
stead.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Butlers
and Kavanaghs.
Bellingham
Deputy,
1548.</div>

<p>Bellingham landed at Dalkey on May 18, 1548, and the
state of Leinster at once engaged his attention. Moryt Oge
Kavanagh had taken a horse and other property from a
neighbour, and Bellingham called upon Cahir MacArt to
restore it, and to punish the thief. The chief denied all
responsibility, on the ground that the culprit was in Sir
Richard Butler&#8217;s suite, and that he could not in any case
hang a man for stealing, but only enforce restitution according
to the Brehon law. We can now see that in this at least
Cahir MacArt was more nearly right than the English lawyers.
Moryt Oge had grievances, and said that he was
oppressed by one Watkin Powell, but he restored the horse,
subject to the Lord Deputy&#8217;s opinion as to whether he had
a right to it as a set off against his own losses. He came to
Carlow to plead his own cause, but Sir Richard Butler, who
had promised to meet him, did not appear. Butler was
accused of showing a bad example in the country by plundering
houses, wounding men, and taking gentlewomen prisoners.
If this, or even a small part of it, were true of the
Earl of Ormonde&#8217;s brother, it is not surprising that robberies
should have been things of every-day occurrence.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The Pale
constantly
threatened.</div>

<p>The defenders of the Pale were fully occupied. Having
consulted such men in England as understood Irish affairs, the
Privy Council concluded that the principal damage was done
&#8216;skulkingly in the winter&#8217;s nights.&#8217; If the Lord Deputy&#8217;s
presence near the border was not enough to prevent incursion,
soldiers accustomed to the country were to be quartered there
permanently, and nightly watch to be kept, especially on
O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s side. Truces were not to last beyond the winter.
This border service must have been very disagreeable. John
Brereton, who held the office of seneschal of Wexford, of
which the duties were very ill discharged by Watkin Powell,
was stationed at Kildare, and complained bitterly that he
was harassed to death. He could get no leave because he
had no second captain, and even in May and June he could
scarcely enjoy an undisturbed night. At one time he was
roused from his bed by shouts, at another by the announcement
that some alarm beacon was blazing. On foot or on
horseback he had to march at once, and yet he was unable
to answer every summons. A proprietor at Rathangan, who
is called Raymond Oge, had his haggard burned by some of
the O&#8217;Connor kerne. Two English troopers were with him
by chance and helped to defend his castle, but the fires which
they lit on the roof were not answered. Horses left out in a
bog near a wood were carried off and the keepers killed.
Nothing was safe unless shut up in a bawn, or fortified courtyard.
Owen MacHugh O&#8217;Byrne, who was retained permanently
by the Government as a captain of kerne, was inclined
to do good service, but his men would not advance beyond
Lea Castle, saying that &#8216;if Captain Cosby wanted wilfully to
lose his life, they did not set so little by their lives.&#8217; Cosby
was a man of great personal courage. The Constable of Lea,
the same James Fitzgerald whose allegiance in Grey&#8217;s time
had been so elastic, required a letter from Bellingham to encourage
him. The Lord Deputy himself spent some time at
Athy, where eighteen beds were provided for him and his
suite; but the border was never quiet for a moment. Fitzgerald
and Cosby had no official authority, and their orders
carried no weight. If a cow strayed an alarm was raised, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
while soldiers were sent on a fool&#8217;s errand in one direction,
the rebels or brigands had their time to themselves. O&#8217;More
came to the Barrow and carried off horses and sheep. Owen
MacHugh skirmished with him, but the hostile chief, &#8216;like
a jolly fellow,&#8217; offered the royal kerne 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a fortnight
to serve him, and pay to their leaders in proportion. Before
Cosby could get his men together the O&#8217;Mores had
vanished.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord
Dunboyne.</div>

<p>Other loyal and half loyal partisans were less energetic
than Cosby. Lord Dunboyne complained that his manor of
Fishmoyne in Tipperary had been plundered by the O&#8217;Carrolls
and O&#8217;Meaghers, and this because he had discharged his men
by the Lord Deputy&#8217;s orders. Bellingham retorted that his
lordship lied in his throat; for he had bidden him to entertain
true men instead of rebels, and to discharge no one unless
it could be done safely. He had particularly cautioned him
against &#8216;rashly discharging such as have been malefactors
as your gallowglasses were, and naturally as their captains
were.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pirates.</div>

<p>While the frontiers of the Pale were harassed by robbers,
the loyal ports of the south were in constant dread of pirates.
A rover named Eagle blockaded Kinsale, which was half depopulated
by an epidemic, and another, named Colley, established
himself in a castle belonging to Barry Oge, whose
aunt he married, so that the poor town was quite shut up.
Cork, the citizens told Bellingham, was so well defended by
marshes and waters, &#8216;besides walls and towers which we do
build daily, that we do not fear all the Irishmen in Ireland
and English rebels also, if there be any such, until such time
as your wisdom would repair hither for our refuge.&#8217; John
Tomson, a noted rover, visited both Cork and Waterford.
According to the authorities of the latter city he had &#8216;one
saker of 16-foot long, having four chambers, so that we do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
not see how he may be apprehended.&#8217; In an affray between
the citizens and an armed French vessel Tomson took part
with the foreigner, and the pursuit of them cost Waterford
1,000<i>l.</i> This formidable water-thief was taken by O&#8217;Sullivan
Bere, who made him pay a large ransom. Afterwards Bellingham
rather oddly allowed the Cork men to trade with
Tomson, because it seemed possible that he had received
pardon, and because the goods then on board did not appear
to be stolen. Wine, figs, and sugar were, however, the wares
offered by Tomson and his ally Stephenson, and it is most
likely that they had been stolen at sea from the Portuguese.
Tomson used the occasion to refit and to repair his weapons,
and the Waterford men called upon the Mayor of Cork to
apprehend the pirates; but that prudent official refused to
do so without special orders from Bellingham. Pirates were
unpleasant people to deal with. A gang confined at Waterford
broke their gyves, nearly murdered a fellow-prisoner,

<p>A pirate named Smith sailed into Youghal, but seems to
have taken nothing but loose rigging and spars. He had
long infested these waters, seemingly with no more than six
men, armed with guns and bows. The Youghal fishermen
took heart, and by a combined attack succeeded in capturing
Smith. Other pirates named Cole, Butside, and Strangwych
are mentioned as active about this time. They were all
English, but the trade was by no means confined to any one
nation; for Sir Philip Hoby, the English ambassador at the
imperial court, was instructed to apply for help to suppress a
squadron of twenty sail, manned by lawless desperadoes of all
countries, who infested the Irish coast, and robbed the Emperor&#8217;s
subjects. Logan, a Scotch professor of the art, and
a survivor from Lennox&#8217;s expedition, haunted the coast about
Howth, and took several vessels. Power and Gough, who
robbed a Portuguese ship in Waterford harbour, and ruined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
the foreign trade of that port, were probably of Irish birth.
Desmond, on whom the honorary office of Lord Treasurer,
held by the late Earl of Ormonde, had already been conferred,
received a commission from Lord Admiral Seymour to exercise
his jurisdiction along the coast from Dungarvan to Galway.
The men of the latter town said they could defend themselves
against all Irishmen coming by land, but that they had not a
single piece of artillery to resist attacks from the sea. They
professed unswerving loyalty, as did their neighbours of Limerick,
and Bellingham thanked the latter for their efforts to
keep the Burkes quiet, &#8216;in whom,&#8217; he said, &#8216;the obstinacy is
found to break this order, you the King&#8217;s our own most dear
sovereign lord&#8217;s and master&#8217;s subjects, the mayor, brethren,
and council of Limerick shall proceed to the first and lawful
redress and punishment thereof.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bellingham&#8217;s
campaign
in Leix,
1548.</div>

<p>Before Bellingham came to Ireland a hosting into Leix
had been proclaimed, and he carried it out promptly. The
men of Drogheda were required to furnish a strong contingent,
having &#8216;caused to be mustered all such as are meet for
the war without partiality.&#8217; They had also to furnish carts,
of which it seems the town could only boast three, and there
were complaints of the stringency of Bellingham&#8217;s requisitions;
but he said he would rather they were unfurnished
than he. The Drogheda men did very good service, and the
carts, which were duly paid for, were employed to carry
pioneers&#8217; tools. The soldiers were thus enabled without excessive
fatigue to cut passes through woods, and make causeways
over bogs. After a thirty days&#8217; campaign in Leix,
Bellingham resolved that a town should be built in Leix, and
in the meantime was erected Fort Governor or Protector, in
the place where Maryborough now stands. The citizens of
Dublin were required to assist in making it practicable for
soldiers to act upon the border of Kildare; but they made
excuses, saying that men could not carry arms and tools as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
well. Bellingham sarcastically refuted their argument, &#8216;in
which your experience bitterly condemneth my ignorance.&#8217;
Let them send carts as the Drogheda men had done, and then
one man could do the work of two.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>In August 1548 Cahir O&#8217;Connor, who still kept some
force about him, invaded Kildare. Nicholas Bagenal, Marshal
of the army, fell in with the marauders, and rescued the cattle
taken, though his men were in the proportion of one to sixteen.
Cahir retreated with his troop, and with a multitude
of camp followers and &#8216;slaves,&#8217; who carried their food to what
was considered an unassailable position. Bellingham was
not far off, and he ordered Saintloo to attack them wherever
he could find them. Accompanied by Travers, Brereton, and
Cosby, Saintloo tracked them to a spot surrounded by a bog.
The soldiers struggled manfully through the moss until they
reached hard ground, and a great butchery followed. The
oldest man in Ireland had, as Bellingham supposed, never
seen so many wood-kerne slain in one day. Such was the
slaughter, says this precursor of Cromwell, that none escaped
but by mistake, or hiding them in ambush, &#8216;such was the
great goodness of God to deliver them into our hands.&#8217; The
Old Testament in English was beginning to make its mark
upon language and upon habits of thought.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Disturbances
in
Munster.
Foreign
rumours.</div>

<p>Munster was much disturbed. Edmund Tyrry, the King&#8217;s
bailiff at Cork, had a dispute with some of the Barries about
land. The Earl of Desmond was appealed to, and he took
Tyrry to Lord Barrymore, desiring the latter to do him justice.
Barrymore took the bailiff with him to his court-baron,
or &#8216;parliament,&#8217; and the case was partly heard and adjourned
to a future day. On his return journey towards Cork, Tyrry
was waylaid and murdered. Bellingham demanded justice,
and Lord Barrymore, after some months&#8217; delay, gave up the
murderers, who were doubtless duly executed. But the Barry
country continued to be the scene of frequent outrages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
Lord Barrymore went out one day in the early winter to
drive the cattle of some wild Irishmen, and met with certain
other wild Irish who were going to spoil his tenants. A
fight followed, and the Barries &#8216;killed incontinently little
lack of fourscore of them,&#8217; wherewith, said the Corporation
of Cork, &#8216;we be glad, and so is the Earl of Desmond.&#8217; But
Bellingham was not satisfied with Desmond&#8217;s conduct, nor
easy about the future. James Delahide, always the herald
of a storm, was in Ireland, and probably with the Earl.
Gerald of Kildare might appear again; and there were rumours
that the French meditated a descent and the establishment
of a fortified port at Skerries to command the passage
to Scotland. These fears were not realised; but there were
frequent communications between Desmond and the O&#8217;Briens,
and Bellingham took steps to have everything reported to
him. This vigilance perhaps prevented the Munster chiefs
from moving.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Anarchy in
Connaught.
Garrison at
Athlone.</div>

<p>The death of the newly-created Earl of Clanricarde revived
the normal anarchy of Connaught. Ulick Burke was
acknowledged as captain by the Government and by some of
the inhabitants during the minority of the Earl&#8217;s son Richard.
But another Richard, the heir&#8217;s illegitimate brother, gave so
much trouble that Sir Dermot O&#8217;Shaughnessy, and other
well-disposed chiefs, demanded that the young Earl should
be settled in possession, and that Commissioners should be
sent to Galway for the purpose. The false Richard was,
however, allowed to rule his own immediate district, but not
without strong hints from Bellingham that what the King
gave the King could take away. Burke was reminded that
he had apprehended no notable malefactor, and that the Lord
Deputy would quarrel with no honest Irishman for his sake.
Bellingham had neither time nor force to give to the West,
and the towns of Limerick and Galway had very indifferent
success in their efforts to keep the peace. But the chief
governor&#8217;s reputation for justice was not without effect even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
in Connaught. &#8216;Your lordship&#8217;s famous proceedings,&#8217; wrote
the Archbishop of Tuam, &#8216;being divolgated throughout all
Ireland, to the great fear of misdoers and malefactors all
through the country hereabouts now needing reformation,
more than heretofore, all for lack of justice among them to
be observed.&#8217; Bellingham established a garrison at Athlone,
which overawed the O&#8217;Kellys and O&#8217;Melaghlins; but little
progress was made beyond the Shannon. Robert Dillon, the
lawyer, was the Lord Deputy&#8217;s civil substitute, but the sword
was necessarily in the Baron of Delvin&#8217;s hands, who did
all he could to prevent Dillon from sending messengers to
Dublin. The central districts of Ireland between the Pale
and the great river were at this time the theatre of constant
war, and in this an English, or Anglo-Norman, adventurer
figures conspicuously.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Edmond
Fay.</div>

<p>Edmond Fay, who seems to have had property at Cadamstown,
in the King&#8217;s County, and to have claimed more
than the natives were willing to allow him, was called into
Westmeath by O&#8217;Melaghlin to aid him against his enemies.
The confederates gained some successes, and occupied, among
other places, the historic castle of Kincora. &#8216;Edmond,&#8217; say
the &#8216;Four Masters,&#8217; &#8216;then continued to conquer Delvin in
the King&#8217;s name in opposition to O&#8217;Melaghlin; and thus had
O&#8217;Melaghlin brought a rod into the country to strike himself,
for Edmond a Faii expelled and banished himself and all his
tribe out of Delvin, just as the young swarm expels the old.&#8217;
Fay, who was to some extent supported by the Government,
and who had soldiers with him, drove the MacCoghlans
across the Shannon, and made himself master of most of the
country between Athlone and Slievebloom. Not satisfied
with this he proposed to attack the O&#8217;Carrolls, who joined
the MacCoghlans, and expelled him from his recent conquests.
Fay called on the Government for help, and the whole county,
on both sides of the Brosna, was burned and plundered by
the troops, to whom no resistance was attempted. The Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
demolished Banagher and other castles to prevent their being
occupied, and this became a general practice in like cases.
Cadamstown was afterwards taken by the O&#8217;Carrolls, and
Fay returned to his original obscurity. He seems to have
had the keep of Thady Roe, or the Red Captain, a noted
leader of mercenaries, who held possession of Nenagh. The
O&#8217;Carrolls burned the monastery and town, but the castle
defied their power.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pale is

<p>Towards the close of 1548 Alen was able to report that
there were only about a dozen rebels on the borders of the
Pale. O&#8217;Connor had surrendered at discretion, and his life
was spared in the hope of inducing O&#8217;More to follow his example.
Alen advised that they should be removed from Ireland,
and that work should be found for them at Calais or
Boulogne. &#8216;There are in all,&#8217; he told Paget, &#8216;not twelve
persons wherewith your honour to make a maundie, for when
Christ ministered at His last supper there were twelve, of
whom one was a traitor, and of these ye may have twelve

<div class="sidenote">The
coinage.
A mint.</div>

<p>The Plantagenet kings had made no difference in the coinage
of England and Ireland; but in 1460&mdash;when Richard,
Duke of York, was Lord Lieutenant&mdash;the Parliament of
Drogheda, with the express intention of loosening the tie
between the two islands, declared that coins intrinsically
worth threepence should be struck in Ireland and pass for
fourpence. There was afterwards a further degradation, and
the money struck by Henry VIII. consisted at last of one-half,
or even two-thirds, alloy. &#8216;New coins were introduced
into Ireland,&#8217; say the &#8216;Four Masters,&#8217; with pardonable exaggeration,
&#8216;that is, copper, and the men of Ireland were
obliged to use it as silver.&#8217; Dishonesty had its proverbial
reward, for trade was thrown into confusion and general discontent
engendered. The Corporation of Galway more than
once besought Bellingham to force the new money on the
captain of Clanricarde and Donnell O&#8217;Flaherty. The Corporation
of Kinsale made the same request as to the Courcies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
Barries, and MacCarthies. This was, of course, beyond Bellingham&#8217;s
power, and the Protector went on coining regardless
of Irish complaints. Thomas Agard was Treasurer of the
Dublin Mint, and exercised his office independently of the
Lord Deputy. He was originally in Cromwell&#8217;s service, and
his position not unnaturally brought him into collision with
Lord Leonard Grey, who accused him of making mischief.
Agard, however, said that Grey, &#8216;which is my heavy lord,&#8217;
oppressed him out of spite, because he opposed the Geraldine
faction, and prevented him from setting up broad looms and
dye-works in Dublin. With the politic St. Leger he got on
better, but Bellingham, whose temper was quite as despotic
as Grey&#8217;s, was much disgusted at the independence of the
Mint. Agard leaned to the Puritan side, and praised Bellingham&#8217;s
godly proceedings. God is with you, he wrote to
him, and with all good Christians who love God and their
King, with much more of the same sort. But the Lord
Deputy was not conciliated, and accused Agard of cooking
his accounts, and of embezzling 2,000<i>l.</i> He was not superseded,
and was entrusted with the congenial task of melting
down chalices and crosses, and of turning them into bad
money. The home authorities chose to make Agard independent
in his office; but the stronger nature triumphed,
and the King&#8217;s auditor reported that the Treasurer of the
Mint dared not for his life speak of his business to any but
the Lord Deputy. The debased currency caused much speculation
of an undesirable kind. Thus, Francis Digby, who
had a licence to export Irish wool, found it pay much better
to buy up plate with the current coin and sell it in England
for sterling money. Others took the cue, and it became
necessary to issue a proclamation. It was, of course, no more
possible to prevent the exportation of silver than to change
the ebb and flow of the tides.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His rash
letters to
Somerset,</div>

<p>In November Bellingham paid a short visit to Dublin,
where he found Lady Ormonde with her new husband, Sir
Francis Bryan, who had a commission as Lord Marshal of
Ireland. Bryan, &#8216;the man of youthful conditions,&#8217; as Roger
Ascham called him, was particularly recommended by the
Privy Council to Alen, who could not understand what
Henry VIII. had seen in him worthy of great promotion.
Bellingham hated him from the first, and Alen thought he
would have the same feeling to any one who had married
Lady Ormonde. We have no means of knowing whether he
was in love with her, or whether he hated her, or whether
he merely disliked the alliance as likely to clip his own wings.
His idea of the rights and dignity of his position was high
and even excessive, and was asserted with a fine disregard of
prudence. To Somerset he complained that his credit was bad,
and that he was despised in Ireland because he was thought
to have no power to reward those who had done good service.
He begged that they might be &#8216;fed with some thereof, which
no doubt it is great need of, for the wisest sort have ever
found that good service in Ireland has been less considered
of any place.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">to
Warwick,</div>

<div class="sidenote">and to
Seymour.</div>

<p>In writing to Warwick his words were still stronger, and
he complained bitterly at the slight put on him in the matter
of the mint. &#8216;I am,&#8217; he said, &#8216;at your honourable lordship&#8217;s
commandment; but in respect I am the King&#8217;s Deputy, your
good lordship may determine surely that I will have none
exempt from my authority in Ireland&#8217;s ground, but sore
against my will.&#8217; He had not spent the King&#8217;s treasure in
gambling or riotous living, nor in buying land for himself.
The King&#8217;s responsible servants in Ireland were neglected,
and credit given to backstairs&#8217; suitors &#8216;coming in by the
windows,&#8217; which did more harm than all the rebels and Irishry
in the realm. Some of Warwick&#8217;s letters had hurt him,
whereas the true policy would be to let men &#8216;know that I
am the King&#8217;s Deputy, so that they shall think when they
have my favours things go well with them, and the contrary
when they have them not.&#8217; These letters, and another to
Seymour, gave great, and not unnatural offence, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
Bellingham was fain to beg the admiral&#8217;s pardon and intercession

had promised to bring in Calough O&#8217;Carroll but had not done so,
he wrote a noble letter, but a very imprudent one, considering
the character and position of the chief whom he addressed.
Calough O&#8217;Carroll, he said, had brought his troubles on himself
by allowing his men to plunder, and by refusing to give
them up; he should be well plagued for it according to promise,
until he and his brother found means to come and seek
their own pardon. The O&#8217;Carrolls submitted and were pardoned.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bellingham

<p>Bellingham was above all things a soldier, and he treated
his Council, consisting for the most part of lawyers, in a very
high-handed manner. His old friend Alen remonstrated, and
there is no reason to doubt him here, though he had a way
of quarrelling with successive Deputies. Alen admitted that
Bellingham was quite free from pecuniary self-seeking, but
thought he had more than his share of the other sin which
beset chief governors, ambition namely, and the longing to
rule alone. He had said that it would be a good deed to
hang the whole Council, and he kept the members waiting
for hours among the servants in the ante-room. Alen he
accused personally of feigning sickness when bent on mischief.
Others he threatened to commit if they offended him,
reminding them that he could make or mar their fortunes.
When angry he frequently sent men to a prison without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
warrant of law; &#8216;and I myself,&#8217; said the Chancellor, &#8216;except
I walk warily, look for none other but some time with the
King&#8217;s seal with me to take up my lodging in the castle
of Dublin.&#8217; The Council had become a lifeless, spiritless
corpse, for Bellingham could hear no advice without threats
and taunts. It is not surprising that Privy Councillors
feared to speak frankly, and forced themselves to wait until
this tyranny should be overpast.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bellingham

Desmond.</div>

<p>To a Lord Deputy so jealous for the dignity of his office
nothing could be more distasteful than the power of the House
of Ormonde, which was now wielded by the Countess and her
husband. The Sheriff of Kildare gave a most galling proof of
this power by begging that his communications with Bellingham
might be kept secret for fear of Lady Ormonde&#8217;s displeasure.
She claimed the right to keep gallowglasses in
Kilkenny, and the Lord Deputy infinitely disliked this practice,
which had prevailed for centuries. He wished to keep the
young Earl in England, lest by living at home he should imbibe
exaggerated notions of his own importance. &#8216;His learning
and manners,&#8217; he said, &#8216;would be nothing amended, and the
King&#8217;s authority thereby be nought the more obeyed.&#8217; By
remaining in England till he was of discreet years, he might
learn willingly to abandon his &#8216;usurped insufferable rule,
which I trust he will do yet in time to come.&#8217; Any assumption
of independence on the part of a subject irritated Bellingham
excessively; and when Desmond, whose manners he stigmatised
as detestable, neglected his summons, he set out quietly
from Leighlin with a small party of horse, rode rapidly into
Munster, surprised Desmond sitting by the fire in one of his
castles, and carried him off to Dublin. He set himself to
instruct the rude noble in civilisation and in the nature of
the royal authority, sometimes, if we may believe the chronicler,
&#8216;making him kneel upon his knees an hour together before he
knew his duty.&#8217; This discipline, accompanied doubtless with
kind treatment in other ways, seems to have answered so
well, that, according to the same authority, Desmond &#8216;thought
himself most happy that ever he was acquainted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
said Deputy, and did for ever after so much honour him, as
that continually all his life at every dinner and supper he
would pray for the good Sir Edward Bellingham; and at all

Garrison at
Leighlin
Bridge.</div>

<p>At the beginning of the year 1549 the Privy Council
thanked Bellingham for having brought Ireland to a good
state. They charged him to aid Tyrone against the Scots,
and to be on his guard against French enterprises undertaken
under colour of trading. The forts erected where Maryborough
and Philipstown now are kept Leix and Offaly quiet. Breweries
were at work under the shadow of both, and it was proposed
to start a tan-yard at Fort Protector, as Maryborough
was for the moment called. Bellingham established another
post, which became very important, to command the road
from Dublin to Kilkenny, and thus make the Government less
dependent on the House of Ormonde. The suppressed Carmelite
convent at Leighlin Bridge required but little alteration,
and the Barrow ceased to be a serious obstacle. The Lord
Deputy kept twenty or thirty horses here with the greatest
difficulty, the hay having to be brought from Carlow through
a disturbed country. Irishmen were willing to settle and to
make an example of peaceful cultivation, but they were in
great fear of Lady Ormonde. Walter Cowley, formerly
Solicitor-General and fomenter of discord between St. Leger
and the late Earl, had little good to say of the no longer disconsolate
widow, but praised Sir Francis Bryan for saying
that he would not &#8216;borrow of the law as my Lord of Ormonde
did.&#8217; The expression was called forth by the action of the
Idrone Ryans, who were frightened by the inquiries into
tenure, and came to Lady Ormonde offering to convey their
lands to her and her heirs; the object being to defeat the Act
of Absentees. No doubt the cultivators would have been glad
to pay an easy rent to a powerful neighbour, rather than have
an active new landlord such as Cosby thrust upon them. Sir
Richard Butler, some of whose misdeeds have been already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
mentioned, built a castle in O&#8217;More&#8217;s country without any

Browne and

<p>Doctrinal Protestantism was not formally promulgated in
Bellingham&#8217;s time; but the recognition of the royal supremacy
was pretty general, for he would allow no disobedience. The
Treasurer of St. Patrick&#8217;s, who was refractory, was severely
reprimanded, and threatened with condign punishment. A
Scot who preached at Kilmainham condemned the Mass,
and Archbishop Browne, whose opinions were not perhaps
quite fixed, was accused of inveighing against the stranger,
and of maintaining that those who sided with him were
&#8216;not the King&#8217;s true subjects.&#8217; Means were, however, taken
to spread the order of service which Browne had set on
foot. The Ten Commandments, the Lord&#8217;s Prayer, and the
<cite>Ave Maria</cite> were read and circulated in English, but the Mass
was retained; a confused arrangement which could not last.
Still, the men who controlled the Government and the young
King were known to be favourable to the new doctrines, and
the Scots emissary soon found a distinguished follower in the
Bishop of Meath. Staples had at one time certainly held
opinions less advanced than those of Browne, but he now
went to Dublin and preached a strong Protestant sermon
against the Mass. On returning to his own diocese he found
that he had incurred universal hatred. An Irishman, whose
infant he had christened and named after himself, desired to
have the child re-baptized, &#8216;for he would not have him bear
the name of a heretic.&#8217; A gentleman refused to have his
child confirmed &#8216;by him that denied the sacrament of the
altar.&#8217; The gossips in the market-place at Navan declared
that if the Bishop came to preach there they would stay away,
lest they should learn to be heretics. A lawyer in the neighbourhood
told a crowd of people that Staples deserved to be
burned, &#8216;for if I preached heresy so was I worthy to be burned,
and if I preached right yet was I worthy that kept the truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
from knowledge.&#8217; &#8216;This gentleman,&#8217; Staples quaintly adds,
&#8216;loveth no sodden meat, but can skill only of roasting.&#8217; Another
lawyer, a judge, said it should be proved before the Bishop&#8217;s
face that he preached against learning. The following is too
interesting to omit:&mdash;&#8216;A beneficed man of mine own promotion
came unto me weeping and desired me that he might declare
his mind unto me without my displeasure. I said I was well
content. My Lord, said he, before ye went last to Dublin ye
were the best beloved man in your diocese that ever came in,
and now ye are the worst beloved that ever came here. I
asked why? &#8220;Why,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;ye have taken open part with
the State that false heretic, and preached against the sacrament
of the altar, and deny saints, and will make us worse
than Jews: if the country wist how they would eat you;&#8221; and
he besought me to take heed of myself, for he feared more
than he durst tell me. &#8220;Ye have,&#8221; he said, &#8220;more curses than
ye have hairs of your head, and I advise you for Christ sake
not to preach at the Navan as I hear ye will do.&#8221; I said it
was my charge to preach, and because there was most resort
(God willing) I would not fail but preach there. Hereby ye
may perceive what case I am in, but I put all to God.&#8217; The
Bishop spoke as became his office, but he was &#8216;afraid of his
life divers ways.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bellingham
and
Dowdall.</div>

<p>Bellingham had information of what was going on in
England by private as well as official correspondence.
John Issam, a strong Protestant, who was afterwards made
seneschal of Wexford, wrote from London an account of the
variations of opinion upon the all-important question of the
sacrament. &#8216;There is great sticking,&#8217; he said, &#8216;about the
blessed body and bloode of Jesus Christ, howbeit, I trust that
they will conclude well in it, by the help of the Holy Spirit,
without which such matters cannot well be tried; but part of
our bishops that have been most stiff in opinions of the reality
of His body there, as He was here in earth, should be in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
bread, they now confess and say that they were never of that
opinion, but by His mighty power in spirit, and leaveth His
body sitting on the right hand of His Father, as our common
creed testifieth; but yet there is hard hold with some to the
contrary, who shall relent when it pleaseth God.&#8217; Bellingham
certainly did what he could to spread the reformed doctrines,
but this was, perhaps, not much. His letter to Primate
Dowdall, who had acknowledged the royal supremacy, but
was inflexible on the question of the sacrament, is instinct
with the spirit of Christian sincerity.</p>

<p>&#8216;My Lord Primate,&#8217; he says, &#8216;I pray you lovingly and
charitably to be circumspect in your doings, and consider
how God hath liberally given you divers gifts, and namely,
of reputation among the people ... Let all these in part
be with the gratuity of setting forth the plain, simple, and
naked truth recompensed, and the way to do the same is to
know that which, with a mild and humble spirit wished,
sought, and prayed for, will most certainly be given, which I
pray God grant us both.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bellingham
advances the
royal
supremacy.</div>

<p>Bellingham could do nothing with Dowdall; but in the
spring of 1549 all the priests in the Kilkenny district not
physically incapable of travelling were summoned to meet
the Lord Deputy and Council. It was ordered that the
Attorney-General should exercise jurisdiction in ecclesiastical
matters, and &#8216;abolish idolatry, papistry, the Mass sacrament,
and the like.&#8217; The Archbishop of Cashel seems to have had
no great zeal for the work. Nicholas Fitzwilliam, Treasurer
of St. Patrick&#8217;s, received a stinging rebuke for his hesitation
to carry out the royal commands. The innovations were distasteful
to most men in Ireland, but Bellingham was recognised
as one who would use his patronage conscientiously,
and not job in the usual style. John Brereton, a decided
Protestant, recommended to him &#8216;for the love of God and
the zeal that you have for the education of Christ&#8217;s flock,&#8217;
a poor priest who was willing to go into a certain district
where he had friends, and where there was no one to declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
the true worship. The suppliant, who was both learned and
earnest, could expect favour from no nother&#8217;s (<i>sic</i>) hand, because
he &#8216;is but poor and has no money to give as his adversaries
do.&#8217; Auditor Brasier told Somerset that &#8216;there was
never Deputy in the realm that went the right way, as he
doth, both for the setting forth of God&#8217;s Word to His honour,
and to the wealth of the King&#8217;s Highness&#8217; subjects.&#8217; But
these praises did not serve to prolong his term of office, and
he left Ireland without effecting the reforms which he had at
heart.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bellingham
leaves
Ireland,
1549. His
character.</div>

<p>Bellingham&#8217;s departure from Ireland followed pretty closely
on the Protector&#8217;s eclipse, though it is not quite certain that
it was caused by it. Warwick may have borne malice for
past lectures, but the Lord Deputy seems to have defended
himself successfully, and might have been sent back had he
not excused himself on account of ill-health. The malady
proved fatal, but he seems to have retained office till his death.
There has been a tendency among those who find their ideal
realised in a strong man armed, to represent Bellingham as a
model ruler. It appears from his letters and from general
testimony that he was honest, brave, loyal, and sincerely religious;
but his incessant wars were very burdensome, and it
is noted that he exacted the unpopular cess more stringently
than its inventor St. Leger had done. But he was a true-dealing
man, took nothing without punctual payment, and
&#8216;could not abide the cry of the poor.&#8217; From the love of gain,
that common vice of provincial governors, he was absolutely
free, and made a point of spending all his official income in
hospitality, saying that the meat and drink in his house were
not his own, but his dear master&#8217;s. For the King&#8217;s honour
he paid his own travelling expenses, and insisted on doing
the like even when Lord Baltinglass entertained him sumptuously.
Alen, who criticised his official conduct so sharply,
could not but allow that he was &#8216;the best man of war that
ever he had seen in Ireland.&#8217; The figure of the Puritan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
soldier has its charms; but the sword of the Lord and of
Gideon is not a good instrument of civil government. Absolutism
may be apparently successful under a beneficent despot,
but who is to guarantee that his successor shall not be a
villain or a fool? Bellingham&#8217;s forts did their own work,
but his ascendency over lawyers in Dublin and ambitious
chiefs in the country was purely personal, and had no lasting
effect. There was much to admire in his character, but
distance has lent it enchantment, and in practice not much
permanent work could be done by a governor of whom
the most striking fact recorded is that &#8216;he wore ever his
harness, and so did all those whom he liked of.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bryan,

Mischief
brewing.</div>

<p>As soon as Bellingham had left Ireland the Council
unanimously elected Bryan Lord Justice. The Irish, though
overawed by the departed Deputy, had been plotting in the
usual way, and after all that had passed Lord Thomond and
O&#8217;Carroll were sworn allies. The Kavanaghs were known to
be meditating mischief, and Desmond was not to be depended
on. Lady Ormonde had been quarrelling with Lady Desmond,
and Alen took credit to himself for having made a truce between
them. To the usual elements of discord were added
many rumours of Scotch and French invasions. O&#8217;Neill,
O&#8217;Donnell, O&#8217;Dogherty, and others proposed to become subjects
of France, in consideration of help from thence, and of the
most Christian King&#8217;s good offices with the Pope. Monluc,
Bishop of Valence, returning from his mission to the Scottish
Court, was directed by Henry to take Ireland on his way, and
to gain all the information possible. Sir James Melville, then
a boy, accompanied him. &#8216;Before our landing,&#8217; he says, &#8216;we
sent one George Paris, who had been sent into Scotland by
the great O&#8217;Neill and his associates, who landed in the house
of a gentleman who had married O&#8217;Dogherty&#8217;s daughter,
dwelling at the Loch edge. He came aboard and welcomed
us, and conveyed us to his house, which was a great dark
tower, where we had cold cheer&mdash;as herring and biscuit&mdash;for
it was Lentroun.&#8217; One De Botte, a Breton merchant, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
also sent on secret service to Ireland apparently about the

<div class="sidenote">Death of

<p>At this juncture Bryan died at Clonmel under circumstances
apparently somewhat suspicious, for there was a post-mortem
examination. He had refused to take any medicine,
and the doctors, who detected no physical unsoundness, prudently
declared that he died of grief; we are not told for
what. &#8216;But whereof soever he died,&#8217; says Alen, who was
present both at the death and the autopsy, &#8216;he departed very
godly.&#8217; Lady Ormonde, who must have had a rooted dislike
to single life, immediately recurred to her plan of marrying
Gerald of Desmond, and the Chancellor had to remonstrate on
the scandal of so soon supplying the place of two such noble
husbands. The danger of putting both the Ormonde and
Desmond interests in the same hand was obvious. The
Geraldines were already too powerful, and what might not be
the consequence of throwing the weight of the Butlers into
the same scale, and making them more Irish and less loyal
than they had been before? In the end she promised to
remain sole for one year. &#8216;Nevertheless,&#8217; said Alen, &#8216;I would
my lords (if they take her marriage of any moment) trusted
a woman&#8217;s promise no further than in such a case it is to be
trusted!&#8217; Her marriage took place in the end with beneficial
results: for Lady Ormonde was able to keep some sort of
peace between her husband and her son, and thus saved much
misery and bloodshed. Immediately after her death the
quarrel broke out anew, and ended only with the extinction
of the House of Desmond.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>On the day of Bryan&#8217;s death the Council elected Brabazon to

Limerick to arrange disputes among the O&#8217;Briens and between
Thomond and Desmond. Before the complicated complaints had
been all heard his presence was required in Dublin on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
of the disturbed state of the North; a most dangerous visitor
having landed in Tyrconnel. This was the Papal Primate,
Robert Wauchop&mdash;Dowdall, who had acknowledged the royal
supremacy, though without accepting any of the new doctrines,
not being acknowledged at Rome. The actual Primate kept
himself well informed as to the movements of his rival, whom
he understood to be a &#8216;very shrewd spy and great brewer of
war and sedition.&#8217; There were many French and Scotch
ready to attack Ireland, and the former had already manned
and armed two castles in Innishowen. Tyrone gave Dowdall
letters which he had received from the French king, and the
Archbishop, with his consent, forwarded them to the Council.
Tyrone swore before the Dean and Chapter of Armagh that he
had sent no answers, and that he would remain faithful to the
King. He did not acknowledge Wauchop&#8217;s claims, but merely
reported that he called himself Primate, and that he was accompanied
by two Frenchmen of rank, who were supposed to
be forerunners of countless Scotch and French invaders. The
Council warned Tyrone that the French wished to conquer
Ireland, and to reduce him and his clan to slavery and insignificance.
He was reminded that they had been expelled
from Italy and Sicily for their more than Turkish ferocity and
rapacity. French messages were also sent to O&#8217;Donnell, but
no letters, as he had transmitted some formerly received to the
Government. He professed his loyalty, and declared that he
would not recognise Wauchop unless the Council wished it.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign

<p>In all these intrigues we find one George Paris, or
Parish, engaged. He was a man whose ancestors had held
land in Ireland, of which they had been deprived, and he
was perhaps related to the traitor of Maynooth. This man
came and went between France and Ireland, and though the
threatened attack was averted by the peace concluded by
England with France and Scotland, his services were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
dispensed with. Henry said that the intrigues had ceased
with the peace, but the English ambassador knew that his
Majesty had had an interview with Paris less than a week
before. Paris told everyone that all the nobility of Ireland
were resolved to cast off the English yoke for fear of losing
all their lands, as the O&#8217;Mores and O&#8217;Connors had done. He
boasted that he himself had begged Trim Castle of the French
king to make up for the lands which the English had deprived
him of. The Constable spoke as smoothly and not
much more truly than the King. Monluc was still employed in
the matter, had interviews with Paris, and gave him money.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Leger

Deputy.
Alen displaced,
1550.</div>

<p>After Bellingham&#8217;s death it was determined to send St.
Leger over again, though he disliked the service, and though
the Irish Chancellor continued to indite bulky minutes against
him. It was felt that the two could hardly agree, and Alen was
turned out of the Council and deprived of the great seal, which
was given to Cusack. His advice was nevertheless occasionally
asked. A year later he received 200 marks pension from
the date of his dismissal, though he had only asked for 100<i>l.</i>
Many charges were made against him, the truest, though he
indignantly denied it, being that he could not agree with
others. But after careful search no fault of any moment
could be found in him, and he had served very industriously
in Ireland for twenty-two years. With all his opportunities
he declared that he had gained only nine and a half acres of
Irish land. St. Leger and his friends, who were for conciliating
rather than repressing the Irish, naturally disliked
Alen. He had a decided taste for intrigue; but if we regard
him as a mere English official, diligent and useful, though
narrow and touchy, he must be allowed to have had his
value.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

adopts a
conciliatory
policy.</div>

<p>The new Lord Deputy&#8217;s salary was fixed at 1,000<i>l.</i> a year
from his predecessor&#8217;s death, though St. Leger, who alleged
that he was already 500<i>l.</i> the poorer for Ireland, fought hard
for 1,500<i>l.</i> He retained his old privilege of importing 1,000
quarters of wheat and 1,000 quarters of malt yearly, to be
consumed only in Ireland. The appointment was evidently
intended to restore some confidence among the natives, who
had been scared by Bellingham&#8217;s high-handed policy. St.
Leger having suggested that Irishmen should be &#8216;handled with
the more humanity lest they by extremity should adhere to
other foreign Powers,&#8217; he was directed to &#8216;use gentleness to
such as shall show themselves conformable,&#8217; that great Roman
maxim of empire which has been so often neglected in Ireland.
Encouraging letters were to be sent to Desmond,
Thomond, and Clanricarde; and to MacWilliam, the O&#8217;Donnells,
O&#8217;Reilly, O&#8217;Kane, and MacQuillin. Pieces of scarlet
cloth and silver cups to the value of 100<i>l.</i> were to be distributed
to the best advantage among them. Particular instructions
were given for reforming the military establishments,
and officers were not to be allowed to have more than 10 per
cent. of Irish among their men. Coyne and livery, the most
fertile source of licence and disorder, was to be eschewed as
far as possible. Irish noblemen were to be encouraged to
exchange some of their lands for property in England, and
thus to give pledges for good behaviour. In Leix and Offaly
leases for twenty-one years were to be given; and religious
reform was everywhere to be taken in hand. One very
curious power was given to the Lord Deputy. When England
was at war with France or the Empire, he was authorised
to license subjects of those Powers to import merchandise
under royal protection, excepting such articles as
were under a special embargo.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Hesitation

<p>St. Leger was ordered to set forth the Church service in
English, according to the royal ordinances, in all places where
it was possible to muster a congregation who understood the
language. Elsewhere the words were to be translated truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
into Irish, until such time as the people should be brought
to a knowledge of English. But small pains were taken to
carry out the latter design, and the Venetian agent reported,
with practical accuracy, that the Form of Common Prayer and
Administration of the Sacraments was not enforced in Ireland
or other islands subject to England where English was not
understood. The book still remains that of the English
colony, and of no one else in Ireland. Cranmer and Elizabeth
both saw the necessity of attempting to reach the Irish
through their own tongue, but neither were able to do it.
When Bedell, at a later period, threw himself heart and soul
into the cause, he received not only no encouragement, but
positive opposition, from the Government; and in any case
the breach was probably then past mending. Protestantism
had become identified in the Irish mind with conquest and
confiscation, a view of the case which was sedulously encouraged
by Jesuits and other foreign emissaries.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bad state
of the
garrisons.</div>

<p>St. Leger lost no time in visiting the forts in Leix and
Offaly, and he found there the disorder natural to, and perhaps
pardonable in, an ill-paid soldiery. Bellingham had
complained more than a year before that so many women of
the country&mdash;Moabitish women he would have called them
had he lived a century later&mdash;were received into Fort Protector.
Some officers indignantly denied this, &#8216;and as to
our misdemeanour in any point,&#8217; they added, &#8216;we put that
to the honestest men and women in the fort.&#8217; If this report
was true, discipline had been much relaxed in a year and
nine months, for St. Leger found as many women of bad
character as there were soldiers in the forts. Divine service
there had been none for three years, and only one sermon.
Staples, who was the preacher on that solitary occasion, &#8216;had
so little reverence as he had no great haste eftsoons to preach
there.&#8217; There was also a want of garrison artillery; and
eight pieces of cannon, with forty smaller pieces called bases,
were demanded by the Master of the Ordnance. He also
asked for 400 harquebusses, and for bows, which the Dugald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
Dalgettys of the day had not yet learned to despise. There
were rumours of a French invasion, and it was proposed to
send a strong expedition to Ireland&mdash;six ships with attendant
galleys, 1,000 men, including many artificers to be employed
in fortifying Baltimore, Berehaven, and other places in the
south-west, and the mouths of the Bann and of Lough Larne
in the north-east. The Constables of Carrickfergus and
Olderfleet were ordered to put those castles in order for fear
of Scots. Lord Cobham was designated as leader of the expedition,
and the Irish Government were directed at once to
survey Cork, Kinsale, and other southern harbours.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

days at Holyhead for fear of five great ships which he saw
drifting about in the tideway. In the end he secured a
quick and safe passage by hiring a twenty-five ton pinnace
with sixteen oars, into which he put twenty-five well-armed
men. St. Leger had been complaining bitterly that he could
get no money out of the mint, although 2,000<i>l.</i> was owing.
Pirry seems to have had only a limited authority, for though
over 7,000<i>l.</i> was delivered by him on the Lord Deputy&#8217;s warrant,
St. Leger still objected that he had to make bricks
without straw, and to put port towns in a posture of defence
without being allowed to draw for the necessary expenses.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>The expedition did not take place, but Sir James Croft
was sent over with instructions to inspect all the harbours
between Berehaven and Cork, to make plans of the most important,
and to select sites for fortification; utilising existing
buildings as much as possible, and taking steps for the acquisition
of the necessary land. He was then to extend his
operations as far east as Waterford, acting in all things in
concert with the Lord Deputy. It is evident that things were
in a state quite unfit to resist a powerful French armament;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
but the weather as usual was on the side of England, and of
eighteen French vessels laden with provisions, more than one-half
were lost in a storm off the Irish coast. This fleet was,
no doubt, destined only for the relief of the French party in
Scotland, and there does not seem to have been any real intention
of breaking the peace with England. But the Irish
exiles were unwilling to believe this. George Paris, who had
been despatched from Blois about Christmas 1550, returned
to France in the following spring, bringing with him an Irishman
of importance. The Irish offered Ireland to Henry, and
begged him to defend <em>his own</em>, saying that Wales would also
rise as soon as foreign aid appeared. Their avowed object
was &#8216;the maintenance of religion, and for the continuance of
God&#8217;s service in such sort as they had received from their
fathers. In the which quarrel they were determined either
to stand or to die.&#8217; It would be better to invade England
than Ireland; for the English Catholics would receive an
invader with open arms. Paris spoke much of the frequent
conquests of England. No outward enemy, once landed, had
ever been repulsed, and the thing was easier now than ever.
The sanguine plotter talked loudly of all that had been promised
him, and professed to believe that the Dauphin would
soon be King of Ireland and Scotland at the very least.
&#8216;With these brags, and such others, he filleth every man&#8217;s
ears that he chanceth to talk withal.&#8217; He had constant interviews
with the Nuncio, but the French grew every day cooler.
The English ambassador perceived that the Irish envoy was
&#8216;not so brag,&#8217; and at last reported that he had been denied
help. He attributed this change of policy entirely to the fear
of increasing the difficulties in which the Queen Dowager of
Scotland already found herself.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties
in Ulster.
Andrew
Brereton.</div>

<p>While Scots and Frenchmen threatened its shores, Ulster
furnished more even than its normal share of home-grown
strife. Captain Andrew Brereton, who seems to have been a
son or grandson of Sir William Brereton, held Lecale as a
Crown tenant at will. He was a man singularly unfit to deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
with a high-spirited race like the O&#8217;Neills. When Tyrone,
according to ancient Irish custom, sent a party to distrain for
rent among the MacCartans, Brereton set upon them and
killed several men, including two brothers of the Countess.
To the Earl&#8217;s remonstrances he replied by calling him a traitor,
and threatening to treat him as he had treated O&#8217;Hanlon&mdash;that
is, to spoil him, slay his men, and burn his country. It
is clear that Brereton was not actuated by any special love of
the MacCartans, for he beheaded a gentleman of that clan&mdash;without
trial. He forcibly expelled Prior Magennis from his
farm on the church lands of Down; and Roger Broke, a congenial
spirit, shut up the Prior in Dundrum Castle. Tyrone
went to Dublin to welcome St. Leger on his arrival, and
Brereton openly called him a traitor at the Council Board, in
the presence of the Lord Deputy and of the Earls of Thomond
and Clanricarde. The proud O&#8217;Neill of course took the
accusation &#8216;very unkindly.&#8217; St. Leger was of opinion that
such handling of wild men had done much harm in Ireland;
and the Council, while admitting that Tyrone was &#8216;a frail
man, and not the perfectest of subjects,&#8217; thought that this
was not the way to make the best of him. Brereton had no
better justification for his conduct than the gossip of one
of MacQuillin&#8217;s kerne, who said that Tyrone had sent a
messenger to the King of France to say that he would take
his part against King Edward, and would send him Brereton
and Bagenal as prisoners. Brereton was very properly relieved
of his command in Lecale, on the nominal ground that he had
refused to hold the Crown land there upon the Lord Deputy&#8217;s
terms; which St. Leger evidently thought more likely to have
weight with the English Council than any amount of outrages
committed against the Irish. He was afterwards restored,
and gave trouble to later governors.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">FROM THE YEAR 1551 TO THE DEATH OF EDWARD VI.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">The Reformation
officially
promulgated,
1551.</div>

<p>No Parliament was held in Ireland during Edward VI.&#8217;s
reign; and the official establishment of Protestantism is generally
supposed to date from a royal order, dated Feb. 6, 1551,
and promulgated by the Lord Deputy on the first day of the
following month. But the new Liturgy had been already
introduced, and copies had been forwarded to Limerick, and
perhaps to other places. St. Leger, who felt that the Communion
Service was the really important thing, had it translated
into Latin for the benefit of those who had some tincture
of letters, but who could not read English. The citizens of
Limerick made no difficulty about receiving the new formulary;
but the Bishop, John Quin, refused, and was therefore
forced to resign. Quin, who was old and blind, had been
willing to acknowledge the royal supremacy, but very naturally
refused to embrace a new faith. It has often been stated
that Quin accepted the Reformation; but it is not easy to see
how this can be reconciled with the facts. His successor was
William Casey, whose consecrators were Archbishop Browne,
Lancaster of Kildare, and Devereux of Ferns. The two last
had been consecrated by Browne and by Travers of Leighlin.
Travers had only just been appointed himself, and was probably
in pretty nearly the same condition.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Doctrinal
conference
in Dublin.</div>

<p>Immediately after the arrival of the momentous order, St.
Leger summoned the clergy to meet him in Dublin. To this
assembly the royal mandate was read, as well as the opinions
of certain English divines in favour of the proposed changes.
Primate Dowdall at once protested. &#8216;For the general benefit
of our well-beloved subjects,&#8217; the King was made to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
&#8216;whenever assembled and met together in the several parish
churches, either to pray or hear prayers read, that they may
the better join therein in unity, hearts and voices, we have
caused the Liturgy and prayers of the Church to be translated
into our mother tongue of this realm of England.&#8217;
&#8216;Then,&#8217; observed the Primate, &#8216;shall every illiterate fellow
read Mass?&#8217; &#8216;No,&#8217; answered St. Leger with much force,
&#8216;your Grace is mistaken; for we have too many illiterate
priests among us already, who neither can pronounce the
Latin nor know what it means, no more than the common
people that hear them; but when the people hear the Liturgy
in English, they and the priest will then understand what
they pray for.&#8217; This last observation might be true enough
in Dublin, but it was singularly inapplicable to Ireland generally.
The key-note of the controversy had, however, been
struck, and it was clear that the Primate and the Lord Deputy
occupied very different standpoints. Finding St. Leger a formidable
antagonist, and seeing that the case was virtually
prejudged, Dowdall somewhat forgot his habitual dignity,
and threatened the Viceroy with the clergy&#8217;s curse. &#8216;I fear,&#8217;
was the answer, &#8216;no strange curse, so long as I have the
blessing of that Church which I believe to be the true one.&#8217;
There was some further altercation about the Petrine claims
to supremacy; and Dowdall, finding that he made no impression,
left the hall with all his suffragans except Staples,
and repaired to his own diocese. St. Leger then handed the
King&#8217;s order to Browne, who received it standing. &#8216;This
order, good brethren,&#8217; said the Protestant Archbishop, &#8216;is
from our gracious King, and from the rest of our brethren,
the fathers and clergy of England, who have consulted herein,
and compared the Holy Scriptures with what they have done;
unto whom I submit, as Jesus did to Cæsar, in all things just
and lawful, making no question why or wherefore, as we own
him our true and lawful King.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Leger,
Browne,
and
Dowdall.</div>

<p>The above proceedings show that St. Leger was at least
in general agreement with the Protestant party, but he had
certainly no wish to force the reformed doctrines on the reluctant
Irish. Browne complained that he had publicly
offered the sacrifice of the Mass in Christ Church, &#8216;after the
old sort, to the altar then of stone, to the comfort of his too
many like Papists, and the discouragement of the professors
of God&#8217;s Word.&#8217; The Archbishop found it convenient to forget
that this was strictly according to law; and that the royal
order, even admitting that it had all the power claimed for it,
had not yet gone forth to alter the state of things established
under Henry VIII. Browne could not deny that the Lord
Deputy had made due proclamation of &#8216;the King&#8217;s Majesty&#8217;s
most godly proceeding;&#8217; but alleged that it was only for show,
&#8216;while massing, holy water, Candlemas candles, and such
like, continued under the Primate and elsewhere,&#8217; without let
or hindrance from the chief governor. Dowdall, he said, was
&#8216;the next father in word and deed of Popery;&#8217; the Viceroy
a Gallio who did not scruple to say, &#8216;Go to, your matters of
religion will mar all.&#8217; St. Leger seems in good truth to have
been laughing at the ex-friar. &#8216;My Lord of Dublin,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;I have books for your Lordship.&#8217; Browne found them on
examination &#8216;so poisoned to maintain the Mass with Transubstantiation,
and other naughtiness (as at no time I have
seen such a summary of Scriptures collected to establish the
idolatry), clean contrary the sincere meaning of the Word of
God and the King&#8217;s most godly proceedings.&#8217; The Archbishop
had copies taken, which he sent to the Privy Council.
St. Leger was angry at this, and Browne says he threatened
to do him harm, even should it cost 1,000<i>l.</i> The Archbishop
intimated that the 1,000<i>l.</i> would be nothing to him, for that
he had enriched himself by peculation, and attributed to him
a degree of vindictiveness which does not seem really to have
belonged to his character. Browne admits that the Lord
Deputy called Dowdall before the Council for practising the
old ritual, &#8216;who came and disputed plainly the massing and
other things, contrary the King&#8217;s proceedings; and that he
would not embrace them: whereat the Deputy said nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>&#8217;
Sir Ralph Bagenal called the Primate an arrant traitor. &#8216;No
traitor, Mr. Bagenal,&#8217; said Lord Chancellor Cusack, who was
Dowdall&#8217;s cousin; and the Primate continued in his old ways
as long as St. Leger held the reins of government. The Lord
Deputy even recommended Tyrone to &#8216;follow the counsel of
that good father, sage senator, and godly bishop, my Lord
Primate, in everything, and so ye shall do well.&#8217; He made
indeed no secret of his regard for Dowdall, whose high character
was admitted by all but fanatics. &#8216;He is,&#8217; he declared
openly before more than a dozen persons in the hall of Dublin
Castle, &#8216;a good man, and I would that all the Irishmen in
Ireland spake so good English as he, and if they do no worse
than he the King had been the better served.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Leger
has some
idea of
toleration.</div>

<p>It was impossible that any secret policy could go on
without Alen having a hand in it. St. Leger told him that
the danger from both France and from the Emperor was much
increased by the religious sympathies of the Irish, who, in
civil matters, would like foreigners only in so far as they could
profit by them. He ridiculed the notion of France annexing
Ireland, though he thought it possible that Henry II. might
make a diversion there to prevent England from interfering
with him in Scotland or on the Continent. He thought the
Emperor would be friendly for old acquaintance sake, but that
he disliked the new fashions in religion; &#8216;and no wonder,
seeing that in that matter daily at home among ourselves one
of us is offended with another.&#8217; St. Leger, in short, was a
statesman who could admire moral excellence in men of
different opinions; and Browne was a fanatic. &#8216;God help
me!&#8217; said the Deputy. &#8216;For my own part, knowing the manners
and ignorance of the people, when my lords of the
Council willed me to set forth the matters of religion here,
<em>which to my power I have done</em>, I had rather they had called
me into Spain or any other place where the King should
have had cause to make war, than burdensome to sit further
here. I told my lords no less before my coming away.&#8217;
Alen had refused to put this conversation in writing, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
urged to do so by Browne; saying that he wished St. Leger
no harm, though he had lost all through him. He said as
little as might be against him even when questioned afterwards
by the Council. After his interview with the Lord
Deputy, Alen went to sup with Lockwood, Dean of Christ
Church, and found there the Archbishop and Basnet, late
Dean of St. Patrick&#8217;s. When the servants had gone the conversation
turned upon St. Leger, whom Browne attacked on
the grounds already mentioned, saying that he was but a
&#8216;dissimular in religion.&#8217; He was, in fact, a thoroughly
secular politician, wise and resolute, and willing to carry out
orders from the Government; but not pretending to like the
plan of forcing an English-made religion upon the Irish, and
administering it in practice as gently as possible. He was
really in advance of his time, and had formed some notion of
religious liberty. That he sympathised with the old creed
there is not the smallest reason to suppose. &#8216;They name me
a Papist,&#8217; he said. &#8216;I would to God I were to try it with
them that so nameth me;&#8217; and he was accused in Mary&#8217;s
reign of writing satirical verses against Transubstantiation,
which shows that his opinions were not supposed to be anti-Protestant.
He would have had things stay as they were
under Henry VIII; the royal supremacy acknowledged, and
doctrinal changes left to the action of time, persuasion, and
increased enlightenment.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">These
views not

England.</div>

<p>But these ideas did not recommend themselves to the
English Council, which had now come under Warwick&#8217;s influence.
Neither the bishopric of Leighlin nor that of Ossory
was granted to St. Leger&#8217;s chaplain, James Bicton; though
his patron strenuously defended him against the charge of
Papal leanings, declaring that there was no more competent
man in Ireland, nor one who had better set forth God&#8217;s Word.
Bicton, who had been formerly chaplain to the Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
Ormonde, was of Irish birth, though educated at Oxford, and
was at all events not one of the very ignorant priests whom
St. Leger cast up against his friend the Primate. He
became Dean of Ossory, and had a large chest of books at
Kilkenny, besides a wine cask full at Bristol, for which he
had paid 40<i>l.</i>; and he seems to have supported a poor Irish
scholar at Oxford. It would be difficult to say anything so
good of Travers, who was preferred before him at Leighlin.
Travers owed his promotion to his cousin the Master of the
Ordnance, whose chaplain he had been; but he did no credit
to his blood, scarcely anything being recorded of him but
that he oppressed his clergy and made money out of his see.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir James
Croft
succeeds
St. Leger,
1551.</div>

<p>Whatever was the exact cause of St. Leger&#8217;s recall, it
is likely that he was glad to escape from the thankless
Irish service. Sir James Croft, his successor-designate, was
already in Ireland, and he handed him the reins without
waiting for his patent. Croft was directed to put the seaports
of Munster and Ulster into a defensible state; but the
English Government showed a bad example, for though
Argyle was plotting in the North and MacCarthy in the
South, the artillery was sent over in charge of a clerk only.
MacCarthy was to be apprehended if possible, and also George
Paris, who was &#8216;a common post between Ireland and France,&#8217;
sailing in French ships which were to be overhauled in search
of him. When the thousand men who had been promised
arrived at Cork there was no money to pay them. Croft
and his advisers begged and borrowed till both credit and
provisions were well-nigh exhausted in the barren wilds of
West Cork. Soldiers unpunctually paid could not but be
dangerous, and there was no sort of justice to be obtained in
the country districts. &#8216;If in England,&#8217; said Crofts, using an
apt illustration, &#8216;the place of justice were appointed only at
Dover, I think no man doubts but the people would soon
grow out of order.&#8217; A thorough reform in the official circle,
head and members, was necessary before any great improvement
could be expected in the people. Before leaving Cork,
Croft did what he could to secure local justice by drawing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
regulations for maintaining the peace of the district under
Desmond&#8217;s general superintendence, not greatly differing from
those already supposed to be in force, but with a clause which
shows how the Puritan spirit was working. The Earl and
those joined in authority with him were to have a special care
to &#8216;set forth divine service according to the King&#8217;s proceeding,
and diligently to look for the punishment of harlots, for
which purposes they may call for the bishops and ministers
within their circuit, giving them warning of their duties to
see them punished according to the orders taken in that behalf.&#8217;
MacCarthy More, who had submitted, was required with
his clansmen to swear allegiance to Edward VI. as King, and
also as &#8216;supreme head of the Church in England and Ireland,
and clearly to renounce the Bishop of Rome and all his authority,&#8217;
and take his &#8216;oath on the Bible&#8217; to obey all laws, civil
and ecclesiastical, set forth by the King and his successors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Croft proposes

<p>Archbishop Browne, having got rid of St. Leger, was
loud in praise of his successor&#8217;s activity, who was the first
governor to visit Baltimore (Ballagheyntymore). Crofts proposed
to the Council that a colony of married Englishmen
with their wives and families should be planted in this
remote place, who, after serving as soldiers for a time, would
be able to protect themselves as others had done at Calais.
But the King blamed Croft for visiting Baltimore at all, since
he had not the power to do anything there. In August the
time for fortifying was already past; and there was a danger
that Spanish fishermen might discover the Lord Deputy&#8217;s
intentions, and even find means to forestall them.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ulster
Scots
attacked.
Failure at
Rathlin,
1551.</div>

<p>The affairs of Ulster next engaged the attention of Croft.
The Scots had lately made themselves supreme from the
Giant&#8217;s Causeway to Belfast; and it was determined to attack
them there, and, if possible, to capture the island stronghold
of Rathlin, whither the MacDonnells had transported all the
cattle and horses taken by them in their late raid. A hosting
was accordingly proclaimed for thirty-one days, and the army
mustered at Carrickfergus. The roads being impassable for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
carts, everything had to be carried on pack horses or by
sea. The Lord Deputy himself went by land through the
country of several Irish chiefs, of whose intelligence Chancellor
Cusack, who tells the story, formed a favourable opinion.
Some of them joined the expedition. Meat was abundant
throughout the four days&#8217; journey, at the rate of 10<i>s.</i> a
beef and 16<i>d.</i> a mutton; much less than the prices of the
Pale. Leaving the heavy baggage at Carrickfergus, Croft
advanced to Glenarm, where he encamped. No Scots appeared,
and but few cattle; but immense stores of corn were
found. There lay at Ballycastle four small vessels which
the English men-of-war had captured, and some of the prisoners
from the Scots were brought before the Lord Deputy.
The result of their examination was a resolution at once to
attack Rathlin, where James MacDonnell and his brethren
were. It was found that the captured boats would only carry
200 men, and it was therefore resolved not to risk a landing
unless some more of the Scots vessels could be taken, or
unless the men in the island yielded to the fear of the cannon
upon the English ships. Sir Ralph Bagenal and Captain
Cuffe approached the island with about 100 men, but the
galleys which they wished to seize were at once driven in
shore, and a threatening crowd of Scots hung about the
landing-place, and took no notice of the fire from the ships,
which was probably too vague to endanger them much.
The tide was ebbing, and the invaders seemed to run
no great risk; but the Race of Rathlin, even in the finest
weather, is never quite calm, and a sudden reflux wave lifted
Cuffe&#8217;s boat high and dry on to the rocks. The men, about
twenty-five, were slain on the spot, the officers taken and
held by James MacDonnell as pledges for the return of the
goods taken from him about Glenarm, and for the release of
his brother Sorley Boy, who was a prisoner in Dublin. Croft
was obliged to yield on both points, and the whole expedition
ended in failure. The threat of complaining to the Scots
Government was not likely to weigh much with MacDonnell,
who was on good terms with the anti-English party.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

Ulster.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
O&#8217;Neills
consider
wheat a
dangerous
innovation.</div>

<p>Most of the chiefs of Ulster, who feared the Scots more
than they hated the English, paid their respects to Croft at
Carrickfergus, and were glad to submit their grievances to
his arbitration. Tyrone, O&#8217;Donnell&mdash;with his two rebellious
sons, Calvagh and Hugh&mdash;Maguire, the Baron of Dungannon,
MacQuillin, O&#8217;Neill of Clandeboye, MacCartan, the
Savages, Magennis, and others, had complaints to make, and
the Lord Deputy patched up their differences for a time;
most of them agreeing to pay some rent or tribute to the
King for their lands, and not to employ Scots mercenaries.
Maguire was declared independent both of O&#8217;Neill and
O&#8217;Donnell, and sheriffs were appointed both in Ards and
Clandeboye, which, being part of the Earldom of Ulster,
had once had a feudal organisation. A garrison was left in
Carrickfergus, and a commission charged with abolishing
the Irish laws, &#8216;so as by God&#8217;s grace,&#8217; says the sanguine
Cusack, &#8216;that country since the time of the Earl of March
was not so like to prosper and do well as now.&#8217; A garrison
was also left at Armagh, under command of the Marshal
Nicholas Bagenal, who was joined in commission with the
Baron of Dungannon for the purpose of re-establishing order
in Tyrone, which was utterly wasted through the dissensions
of the Earl and his sons. There were not ten ploughs in the
whole country. Hundreds had died of hunger in the fields.
The Baron&#8217;s lands were better off; for he felt that he owed
his position to King Henry&#8217;s patent, and to please the English
Government he had caused wheat to be largely sown. Tyrone
did his best to burn the Saxon crop, and the people declared
that they would grow it no more; &#8216;for that was the chief
cause (as they said) that the Earl did destroy their corn, for
bringing new things to his country other than hath been
used before. And what the Earl will promise now, within
two hours after he will not abide by the same.&#8217; Most of this
unstable chief&#8217;s fighting men had gone over to his son Shane,
who abused his powers dreadfully. Cusack thought the
people would prefer to have the Baron over them, &#8216;for that
he is indifferent, sober, and discreet, and is a hardy gentleman
of honest conversation and towardness,&#8217; whose country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
was as well ordered as the Pale. Tyrone had no capacity for
government, and was ruled by his wife; but he so far yielded
to the Deputy&#8217;s persuasion as to accept a garrison for Armagh,
and to go first to Drogheda and then to Dublin. Having
been once enticed into the Pale, Tyrone was detained there
against his will. This was done by Cecil&#8217;s advice, who agreed
with Cusack that Tyrone was quite useless in his own country,
and quite unable to control Shane.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shane
O&#8217;Neill and
his brother
Matthew.</div>

<p>Tyrone had, or might have had, a son by Alison Kelly,
the wife of a smith in Dundalk. The mother brought her
boy Matthew at the age of sixteen to the chief, who acknowledged
him as his own, and thus, according to the ancient
Irish law, made him equal with his children of less doubtful
origin. Shane, on the other hand, was the offspring of an
undisputed marriage. Matthew was certainly acknowledged
as an O&#8217;Neill when he was made Baron of Dungannon and
heir to the earldom, but Shane explained the difficulty by
saying that his father was a gentleman, and never denied any
son that was sworn on him, and that he had plenty of them.
Whether there was any election to the chieftainship we do
not know, but Shane was, by the practical adhesion of the
clansmen, in a better position than most Irish tanists.
Thus it strangely happened that Matthew, who was confessedly
born in adultery, was heir to the feudal title, while
Shane, who was certainly legitimate, claimed the reversion of
the tribal sovereignty. The influence of the clergy had probably
weakened or destroyed the old Irish principle that an
adulterine bastard could be brought into the real father&#8217;s
lawful family by acknowledgment, nor could English law
have been altogether without effect; but it is strange to see
one in such a position as Matthew O&#8217;Neill, or Kelly, maintained
by statesmen and lawyers against Shane and his
brothers.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Invasion
of Tyrone.</div>

<p>Whether O&#8217;Neill or Kelly, the Baron of Dungannon was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
a man of resolution and ability. He accompanied Bagenal
on an expedition against Shane, which the Dean of Armagh,
Terence Daniel, or O&#8217;Donnell, tried to prevent by exaggerated
accounts of the distance. The bridge over the Blackwater
was broken down, and the castles at Dungannon were also
dismantled. This became a regular practice in Irish warfare,
in order to prevent the English from placing permanent
garrisons in strong places; and any disposition on their part
to repair such a building was generally frustrated by the
length of time necessary, the difficulty of obtaining labour,
and the want of provisions. When the danger was past the
chief would re-occupy his stronghold, and soon made it serviceable
for raising a revenue, or resisting sudden attacks of
neighbouring tribes. Bagenal met with little resistance during
his raid. Shane appeared on a hill with eighteen horsemen
and sixty kerne, and the Baron of Dungannon advanced
against him with only four followers. &#8216;An the King were
there where thou art,&#8217; said Shane, &#8216;he were mine.&#8217; The
Baron, nothing daunted, answered, &#8216;I am here but the King&#8217;s
man, and that thou shalt well know,&#8217; and spurred his horse
forward. Shane, who was never remarkable for dashing
courage, retired into the wood closely followed by his brother,
who was prevented by the thick covert from using spear or
sword, and who tried to close, but was caught by a branch
at the critical moment, and nearly lost his own seat. Shane
escaped on foot, leaving his horse and arms to the Baron, and
afterwards came to Bagenal on parole, when a truce was
patched up.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>Emboldened by success, the Scots extended their operations
to the south of Belfast, slew John White, landlord of Dufferin,
and proposed to make a settlement on the western shores of
Lough Strangford. Hugh MacNeill Oge, who held the district
between that inlet and Belfast Lough, took their part, and
the Prior Magennis and his kinsman, the Bishop of Dromore,
were authorised to make large offers with a view of detaching
him from his allies; but he refused to come to Bagenal. The
Baron of Dungannon had some trifling success against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
Scots, and another officer drove some of their cattle through
Ards to Strangford, apparently crossing the ferry there,
and thence into the Pale. One thousand cows were also
taken from Hugh MacNeill Oge; but he promptly recouped
himself from the herds of his neighbours on every side,
so that the balance was soon again in his favour. The
expedition was evidently a failure, and the &#8216;Four Masters&#8217;
represent it as a disastrous one; the English and their allies
losing 200 men.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Another
doctrinal
conference.</div>

<p>The general directions to Croft for his conduct in ecclesiastical
matters was much the same as those given to St.
Leger. Public worship in English was to be made general,
and a translation to be made into Irish for use in such places
as required it. He was sworn in on May 23, and on June 16
he wrote to Dowdall, who was at St. Mary&#8217;s Abbey, inviting
him to take part in a conference concerning the disputed
points in religion. The Lord Deputy said much about what
was due to Cæsar, hinted that he should be sorry to see the
Primate removed from his great office, and entreated an
answer by the hands of the Bishop of Meath, who, as chief of
his suffragan, seemed the fittest intermediary. Dowdall answered
very truly that no discussion could bring about agreement
between those who differed as to fundamentals, and
excused himself from waiting on his lordship, as he had for
some time withdrawn from public affairs. Mohammed decided
to go to the mountain, and the discussion took place in
the hall of St. Mary&#8217;s Abbey, Croft being supported by two
bishops, Staples of Meath, who conducted the case for the
Crown, and Lancaster of Kildare. The debate first turned
on the new liturgy, Dowdall treating it as an innovation, and
his opponent as the Mass purified from gross corruptions.
The following is the most remarkable part of what was
said:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dowdall.</i> Was not the Mass from the Apostles&#8217; days?
How can it be proved that the Church of Rome has altered
it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Staples.</i> It is easily proved by our records of England.
For Celestinus, Bishop of Rome, in the fourth century after
Christ, gave the first introit of the Mass which the clergy
were to use for preparation, even the psalm, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Judica me, Deus</i>,
&amp;c., Rome not owning the word Mass till then.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Yes, long before that time; for there was a mass called
St. Ambrose&#8217;s Mass.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> St. Ambrose was before Celestinus; but the two
prayers, which the Church of Rome had foisted and added
unto St. Ambrose&#8217;s works, are not in his general works;
which hath caused a wise and a learned man lately to write
that these two prayers were forged, and not to be really St.
Ambrose&#8217;s.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> What writer dares write or doth say so?</p>

<p><i>S.</i> Erasmus, a man who may well be compared to either
of us, or the standers by. Nay, my lord, no disparagement
if I say so to yourself; for he was a wise and a judicious man,
otherwise I would not have been so bold as to parallel your
lordship with him.</p>

<p><i>Lord Deputy.</i> As for Erasmus&#8217;s parts, would I were such
another: for his parts may parallel him a companion for a
prince.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Pray, my lord, do not hinder our discourse; for I have
a question or two to ask Mr. Staples.</p>

<p><i>L. D.</i> By all means, reverend father, proceed.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Is Erasmus&#8217;s writings more powerful than the precepts
of the Mother Church?</p>

<p><i>S.</i> Not more than the Holy Catholic one, yet more than
the Church of Rome, as that Church hath run into several
errors since St. Ambrose&#8217;s days.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> How hath the Church erred since St. Ambrose&#8217;s days?
Take heed lest you be not excommunicated.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> I have excommunicated myself already from thence.</p>

<p>Opposite opinions were then given about the Virgin and
her power to mediate; and the Primate finally appealed to
the consecration oath, which Staples had taken as well as he.
The Bishop of Meath said he held it safer for his conscience
to break it than to keep it, and he praised the oath of supre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>macy.
And thus, without any approach to an understanding,
but with many mutual expressions of courtesy and goodwill,
the champions of Rome and of England measured swords and
parted.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dowdall
goes away.
The
Primacy
removed to
Dublin.</div>

<p>A few days after this the Primate disappeared, and it was
understood that he had gone abroad like a traitor, as Browne
said, who with indecent haste demanded that the old contest
between Armagh and Dublin should be finally decided in his
favour. Dowdall, he said, claimed by the &#8216;Bishop of Rome&#8217;s
bulls and I by the King&#8217;s majesty and his most noble progenitors&#8217;
grants and gifts.&#8217; He recounted the services of his
predecessors in supporting the Government of the Pale, and
asked not only for the empty title and honours of Primate of
all Ireland, but for &#8216;all and every the spiritual profits, living,
and commodities,&#8217; belonging to Armagh. The King granted
the chief place to Browne, who in the Anglican succession remained
Primate of all Ireland till deprived by Queen Mary.
Those who adhere to Rome of course ignore the interruption
in Dowdall&#8217;s primacy, but his withdrawal beyond seas was
considered as a resignation by the English Government.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Church
patronage.
Bale.</div>

<p>The sees of Armagh, Cashel, and Ossory being vacant,
Croft recommended that they should be filled with peculiar
care. The negligence of the Bishops and other ministers
allowed the old ceremonies to remain in many places. It was
necessary to send over good, zealous men to fill up the bishoprics
as they fell vacant. If this could not be done, Croft begged
that at least he might have a competent adviser in ecclesiastical
matters to enable him to direct the bishops, who were
blind, obstinate, negligent, and very seldom learned. For
Armagh it would be well to choose a divine with some property
in England, who might act as a commissioner for deciding
the daily quarrels arising in the North. For the bishopric
of Ossory, Croft, Protestant as he was, ventured to recommend
Leverous, Gerald of Kildare&#8217;s old tutor, who had been pardoned
for his offence in carrying him out of the realm. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
learning, discretion, and decorous life there was no one
superior in Ireland, and Croft had heard him &#8216;preach such a
sermon, as in his simple opinion he heard not many years.&#8217;
Personally unobjectionable, Leverous was known to be attached
to the old doctrines, and Croft&#8217;s advocacy failed, as he himself
expected. The see of Ossory was conferred after some delay
upon John Bale, a Carmelite friar, born in Suffolk and
educated at Jesus College, Cambridge. The arguments of a
layman, Lord Wentworth, according to his own account, enforced
by the charms of a young lady, according to the account
of his enemies, converted Bale to the Reformation. He married
a wife, who was his companion in all his wanderings and
vicissitudes, and became a professed Protestant. It was not
in his nature to hide his light under a bushel; he preached
openly against the Roman doctrine, and suffered imprisonment
in consequence. Having been released through Cromwell&#8217;s
intercession, he spent eight years in Germany. Returning
to England on Edward&#8217;s accession, he became Poynet&#8217;s
chaplain, and obtained the living of Bishopstoke. The King
happening to see and hear him at Southampton, of his own
accord promoted him to Ossory. Bale was a multifarious
writer, a man of learning and eloquence, and unquestionably
sincere; but coarse and violent, with no respect whatever for
the feelings of others, and remarkably unfit for the task of
persuading an unwilling people to embrace the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward&#8217;s
opinions
about
patronage.</div>

<p>Though partially shorn of its glories, the see of Armagh,
claiming as it did to be founded by the national apostle, was
still of great importance. Pending an appointment in England,
Croft proposed that Basnet, late Dean of St. Patrick&#8217;s, should
enjoy the first-fruits of the vacant see along with the revenues
of his old deanery. The Lord Deputy was moved to this by
the curious practical consideration that Basnet was &#8216;experimented
in the wars of the country.&#8217; Make it worth his while
to live at Armagh, and he would be most useful to Bagenal
and the Baron of Dungannon. But the young King, who had
already opinions of his own, was scandalised at the idea,
and shrunk from making bishops of any but ministers earnest
in setting forth God&#8217;s glory. He directed that Deans and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
Chapters should maintain divine service and preach the gospel
in vacant sees, declaring that he minded the education of his
people above all things. If the dignitaries proved negligent
the Lord Deputy might appoint occasional ministers to do the
duty.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cranmer&#8217;s
difficulties
about Irish
patronage.</div>

<p>Cranmer named four persons as fit for the archbishopric
of Armagh, but none of them were in haste to go to Ireland.
Of these the King selected Richard Turner, a Staffordshire
man, but vicar of Chartam in Kent. Cranmer described him
as an earnest preacher, merry and witty withal, who wanted
nothing, loved nothing, dreamed of nothing but Christ only.
He had shown courage in the late Kentish insurrection, and
that would be a useful quality in Ireland. &#8216;He preached,&#8217;
says Cranmer, &#8216;twice in the camp that was by Canterbury;
for the which the rebels would have hanged him, and he
seemed then more glad to go to hanging, than he doth now
to go to Armachane, he allegeth so many excuses, but the chief
is this, that he shall preach to the walls and stalls, for the
people understand no English. I bear him in hand Yes, and
yet I doubt whether they speak English in the diocese of
Armachane. But if they do not then I say, that if he will
take the pain to learn the Irish tongue (which with diligence
he may do in a year or two) then both his doctrine shall be
more acceptable not only unto his diocese, but also throughout
all Ireland.&#8217; But Turner would not go. Perhaps he estimated
more correctly than Cranmer the difficulty of learning Irish,
and his wit and liveliness would only enable him to forecast
the misery of a man who should preach to unwilling congregations
in halting and uncertain language. Cranmer&#8217;s
other three nominees also failed him; and he then recommended
Hugh Goodacre, who was induced to accept the unenviable
post. The archbishopric of Cashel had not even the
dignity of Armagh to make it attractive, and it remained
vacant during the rest of Edward&#8217;s reign.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pluralities.</div>

<p>The King had a reasonable dislike to pluralities, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
resisted the union of Clonfert and Elphin in the hands of
Clanricarde&#8217;s uncle, Rowland Burke. &#8216;A good pastor,&#8217; he
said, &#8216;cannot nourish two flocks at once, and it agreeth not
with our religion.&#8217; But he gave in when it was proved to
him that the sees were small and poor, and that their union
would be likely to further rather than to hinder religion.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
coinage.</div>

<p>It would have been well if Edward or his advisers had paid
as much attention to honesty in civil government. The
attempt to give a forced course to bad coin had had its usual
evil effects. The Irish currency had always been less pure
than that of England, but practically little difficulty had
occurred until the late changes. An English groat was worth
sixpence Irish, and everyone understood what he was doing.
But now the country was flooded with base coin of uncertain
value, and men bargained, as they do still at Cairo, for sterling
money, foreign crowns, and livres Tournois. Trade with
England was necessarily conducted by means of a reputable
currency; and the whole of the new Irish coinage being only
available for local use, felt the effects of inflation as well as of
its own intrinsic baseness. There was great confusion in
every trade, and all was attributed to the coin, which every
one thought would be cried down, and therefore feared to have
in possession. &#8216;Being put to sale of all men,&#8217; said Croft,
&#8216;and no man desirous to buy it, it must needs be good cheap.&#8217;
It was urged that, coins being only counters for exchange,
they should be taken at the proclaimed price, but Croft rightly
argued that gold and silver had been chosen on account of their
fitness for the purpose and also for their intrinsic value. The
effect of laws against usury is to raise the rate of interest, and
the effect of putting an artificial value on coin, in conjunction
probably with other causes, was to raise necessaries to a famine
price. Corn that had been worth 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> had risen to 40<i>s.</i>;
leather, iron, boots and shoes, wine and hops, had all become
dear. Six herrings sold for a groat. Englishmen, and especially
officials with fixed salaries, could not live in Ireland.
The native Irishman was somewhat better off, for &#8216;he careth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
only for his belly, and that not delicately.&#8217; &#8216;We that are
stipendiaries,&#8217; said the Lord Deputy, &#8216;must live upon our
stipends, and buy with our money which no man esteemeth.&#8217;
The native lords used coyne and livery, and did what they
could to make their vassals keep all provisions in the country,
so that the markets were unsupplied, and the Government
had scarcely any alternative but to practise like extortions.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Evils of a
debased
currency.</div>

<p>The inhabitants of Dublin, Waterford, Limerick, Cork,
Drogheda, and Galway were consulted, and they all attributed
the state of trade to the currency. A petition signed by the
attorneys of those communities, by seven peers, and by many
others of high position was sent to the King; and the petitioners
prayed that the coin might be of the same weight,
value, and fineness in both kingdoms. &#8216;By the whole consent
of the world,&#8217; said the Lord Deputy and Council, &#8216;gold and
silver have gotten the estimation above all other metals, as
metest to make money and be conserved as a treasure, which
estimation cannot be altered by a part or little corner of the
world, though the estimation were had but on a fanciful
opinion, where indeed it is grounded upon good reason, according
to the gifts that nature hath wrought in those metals
whereby they be metest to use for exchange, and to be kept
for a treasure. So as in that kind they have gotten the sovereignty,
like as for other purposes other metals do excel; and
so is everything good, as God said at the beginning, whereof
followeth that the thing which we count naught cometh of
the misuse.&#8217; No laws or proclamation could prevent the
value of money from depending on the quantity of bullion it
contained, and without money exchanges could not be made.
Men saw that an artificial scarceness was created, and blamed
the Government for not taking the obvious step of crying
down the coin. Croft apologised for his importunity in
pressing the currency question, observing that one string
would put a harp out of tune, and that the tuner would
naturally strike that the oftenest. The King&#8217;s advisers did
not deny the facts, but hesitated to make the necessary sacrifice.
Next year, however, they found it absolutely necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
to act. Two of the despised groats were proclaimed equivalent
to fourpence English, and an immediate revival of trade
was the result.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Revenue.
Attempts
at mining.</div>

<p>The hope of making some profit out of Ireland to set
against the cost of governing her had attracted the attention
of Henry VIII.&#8217;s ministers to her mineral resources. Traces
of lead, tin, copper, iron, and alum had been found, and
St. Leger hoped to turn them to account. In the last year
of his reign Henry authorised an advance of 1,000 marks
sterling, and it was thought that the mines would soon be
self-supporting. The only serious attempt made was at
Clonmines, near Bannow, in Wexford. Silver was found
mixed with lead, and much expense was incurred. Germans
were employed in the work under the direction of Joachim
Gundelfinger, and a large mass of ore was raised. A smelting-house
was built at Ross, both wood and coal being used, and
there were stores at Newtown Barry and Ballyhack. There
was some jealousy of the foreigners, who received very high
wages, and it was thought that Englishmen would be better
and cheaper. The English surveyor reported that the
strangers cost 260<i>l.</i> a month, and scarcely earned 40<i>l.</i>, and he
proposed to dismiss them, at least until the work of sinking
deep shafts had been completed by less expensive labour.
The Germans retorted that the surveyor himself was to blame.
But there was sickness among the miners, and some of them
died; and after some further trial the Germans were sent home
and the works stopped. It was found that the King had lost
nearly 6,000<i>l.</i> in two years.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>The early part of the new year was disturbed by rumours
of invasion. Wauchop had just died at Paris, but his spirit
still animated Ulster, and help was confidently expected from
Scotland. The French were trying to recruit in Ireland, and
some of those who held the seaports might as well have been
Frenchmen or Spaniards so far as the State was concerned. Old
O&#8217;Connor, who had received messages and tokens from the
ubiquitous George Paris, managed to escape from the Tower,
but was caught near the border and brought back. Walter
Garrett, a soldier of Berwick, probably an Irishman, who had
deserted and gone as far south as Newcastle, was taken
trying to cross the Tweed or the Solway in a boat without
oars. He confessed his knowledge of O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s movements,
and this roused suspicion as to the fidelity of the great frontier
garrison. Leix and Offaly were still unleased, the forts cost
7,000 marks yearly without any return, and a rising among
the friends of the old chief might undo the little that had been
done. The garrisons were most oppressive, taking 1<i>l.</i> worth
of wheat for five shillings, and 4<i>l.</i> of beef for twelve shillings,
and the people were ready to rebel on the mere chance of
shaking them off.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Tyrone is
detained in
Dublin.</div>

<p>Tyrone and his countess were detained in Dublin, while
Shane continued his fire-raisings in Ulster. The Earl complained
bitterly of his own treatment, of Bagenal&#8217;s incursions,
and of Cusack&#8217;s intrigues. The Marshal had taken 1,000 kine
and 300 mares from him, and had billeted himself and his
army at Armagh. O&#8217;Donnell had suffered from similar extortions.
In St. Leger&#8217;s time, he said, all had been quiet,
and he sent a statement of his grievances to the late Lord
Deputy, who, very wisely, sent it to Northumberland with
the seals unbroken. Against the Chancellor Tyrone could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
find no better accusation than that he had twice dissuaded
him from sending hawks as presents to the King. Cusack
maintained that Tyrone&#8217;s arrest was justified by his negligent
and savage behaviour. &#8216;If there were but one plough in the
country,&#8217; the candid barbarian had boasted, &#8216;he would spend
upon the same, with many other indecent words for a captain
of a country to say.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Anarchy in
Connaught.</div>

<p>The fort at Athlone remained a memorial of Bellingham&#8217;s
military plans, and under its shelter Westmeath submitted to
the government of a sheriff; but it cannot be said that the
garrison kept Connaught quiet, either by force or example.
They sacked Clonmacnoise, and took away the bells from
O&#8217;Rourke&#8217;s Tower, and left neither bell, image, book, gem, nor
window-glass in the whole place. &#8216;Lamentable was this deed,&#8217;
say the annalists, &#8216;the plundering of the city of Ciaran,
the holy saint,&#8217; and by no means calculated to increase the
popularity of the King&#8217;s religion. Whether on account of
this outrage or not, Croft found it necessary to visit Athlone
himself, and try to establish some order in Connaught. The
dissensions of the young Earl of Clanricarde with his kinsman
Ulick, who was loth to part with his authority, had laid the
whole country waste. Cusack with a small force succeeded,
after a few executions, in placing the Earl quietly, and
swearing the gentry of the district to obey him. Agriculture
again flourished, and Cusack boasted that he had increased the
ploughs in use from 40 to 200, and that both ploughs and
cattle could be left safely in the open field. Clanricarde made
use of his new power to seize Roscommon, about which
O&#8217;Connor Roe and O&#8217;Connor Don were disputing, and to hand
it over to Cusack for the reception of a garrison. The warlike
Chancellor brought O&#8217;Kelly to terms, and then succeeded
in getting a promise from the chiefs that they would assemble
a force of 1,500 men to support the Earl in chastising
MacDermot of Moylurg, who had been plundering the
O&#8217;Connors&#8217; cattle. Cusack thought there should be a presi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>dent

and MacWilliam of Mayo, who was well disposed.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Government
of
Leinster.
Gerald of
Kildare
comes to
England.</div>

<p>Leaving Cusack in the West, the Lord Deputy went into
Leinster, and made successful arrangements for maintaining
peace there. He gave a lamentable account of the state of
the country. The Kavanaghs were indeed quiet, and the
O&#8217;Byrnes supported soldiers without grumbling; but the poor
in the towns were starving, and their cry sounded continually
in his ears. They were too wretched even to state their own
grievances, and this was done for them by the neighbouring
gentry. Croft&#8217;s regulations for the garrisons at Carlow and
Leighlin show considerable forethought. The constables
were prohibited from levying contributions themselves, but
might obtain the necessary supplies from the country through
four &#8216;cessers,&#8217; chosen by the freeholders for each garrison.
No kerne were to be quartered on the people, except thirty,
which William Keating covenanted to keep always ready for
police purposes, and these were to be billeted as the &#8216;cessers&#8217;
should appoint. Under the circumstances the young Earl
of Ormonde&#8217;s rents were not very well paid, but Croft managed
to send him 400<i>l.</i> The state of the currency was such
that the Earl would lose one half if it were paid in Ireland.
Gerald of Kildare, who was now in England, was less fortunate,
and the Lord Deputy declared that he could get nothing
for him. At a masque given by the King this adventurous
young man, who was now twenty-seven years old, and very
handsome, had met Mabel Browne, step-daughter to the fair
Geraldine. According to the family historian she fell in love
with him. They were married, and her father&#8217;s influence
procured the honour of knighthood for the returned exile, and
a patent restoring his estate. He did not, however, come to
Ireland till the next reign.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cusack&#8217;s
attempts to
conciliate

<p>Passing eastwards again, Cusack found the O&#8217;Farrells
peacefully paying rent and supporting soldiers, but O&#8217;Reilly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
who had seven warlike sons and 1,600 men, was less submissive.
With 1,200 followers he met the Chancellor, who
had only 200, and agreed to give hostages for the restoration
of spoils taken out of the Pale, and to pay a fine of 200<i>l.</i>
Cusack made it a rule to impose a fine, since the Brehon code
required restitution only; but as the fines were seldom paid,
the chiefs made little real concession. O&#8217;Reilly refused to go
to Dublin, lest he should be imprisoned like Tyrone, but admitted
that that chief deserved his bonds if he had behaved
as Cusack reported, and that he should deserve them also in
like case. The MacMahons and the O&#8217;Hanlons were found
equally well disposed, and Magennis kept house like an
English gentleman, and exercised the office of sheriff of
Down. From this point the Scots&#8217; handiwork began to be
visible. John White, the farmer of Dufferin, had been murdered
by them, and the murderers kept possession of the
district. The fertile lands of Lecale seemed to invite
settlers, but the neighbouring region of Ards warned them
off, being laid waste by the invasions of the islanders.
Hugh MacNeill Boy, the chief of Clandeboye, had agreed to
meet Cusack, but, hearing of the landing of some six or seven
score Scots archers, he broke his appointment. Through his
frequent conflicts with Bagenal there was scarcely anything
left in the country worth destroying, and the Chancellor was
fain to leave a small party of soldiers behind him, and to
await the action of the Council in Dublin. Permanent
garrisons at Belfast and Castlereagh were the means he proposed
for bridling this part of the North. The O&#8217;Cahans and
MacQuillins in northern Antrim were willing to obey the
Baron of Dungannon, but were coerced by the Scots, who
disposed of their force as they pleased. Cusack had a fruitless
interview with the formidable Shane O&#8217;Neill, and Shane
went straight from the meeting to burn his father&#8217;s house at
Dungannon, which was only four miles off. Led by the light,
Cusack&#8217;s horsemen were able to save the building, and he
afterwards succeeded in capturing 700 of Shane&#8217;s kine, and
many horses. The Baron of Dungannon took charge of the
castle, and 300 gallowglasses were quartered on the county,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
but Cusack saw plainly that nothing permanent could be done
without a resident governor. The Chancellor was somewhat
more successful with O&#8217;Donnell and his rebellious son Calvagh,
both of whom came to Dublin and bound themselves to
keep the peace.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>Soon after this the Lord Deputy made another attempt to
punish the Scots for the Rathlin disaster, and Hugh Oge
O&#8217;Neill for supporting them. O&#8217;Neill attacked the advanced
guard at Belfast, then &#8216;an old castle standing on a ford,&#8217; and
killed Savage of Ards, with fifty others. The main body
crossed the Laggan safely, and proceeded to fortify the old
stronghold. Meanwhile the Baron of Dungannon had brought
up his forces, but incautiously encamped in the open field
before effecting a junction with Croft. There he was set
upon by the sleepless Shane, and utterly routed, so that the
whole expedition ended in failure. Sir William Brabazon,
the Vice-Treasurer, who had served so long and so well in
Ireland, died on the march. His body was buried in Christ
Church, Dublin, but his heart, according to the annalists, was
&#8216;sent to the King, in token of his loyalty and truth towards

<p>Tyrone complained to the King of his continued detention.
His country, he said, suffered by his absence, and he offered
either to plead his own cause in England, or to submit unreservedly
to Commissioners sent from thence. Danger was
still feared from Scotland, but the English party there procured
the arrest of George Paris, on the information of one
of O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s sons. On the whole it was thought better to
release Tyrone, his countess and her son remaining as pledges
for him, and Shane&#8217;s brother for that troublesome person.
The Earl bound himself in 6,000<i>l.</i> to keep the peace towards
the King&#8217;s adherents, the Baron of Dungannon, Calvagh
O&#8217;Donnell, Maguire, and Tirlogh Luineach O&#8217;Neill.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

remote parts of his district, and training the wild people;
a task for which few, if any, of his ancestors had shown any

Dungarvan should be taken from the Butlers, and restored to
him. The Chancellor&#8217;s pet idea was to have a President at
Limerick, less as a governor than as a general referee in all

for the future. The latter chief received certain monastic
lands rent free, especially stipulating for the friary at
Carrickfergus, where his ancestors were buried. Belfast Castle
was restored to him. The Government had in fact been
unable to chastise him, and put the best face they could upon
matters. It can hardly be doubted that the three secular

<div class="sidenote">Character
of Croft.
St. Leger
returns to
Ireland.</div>

<p>Sir James Croft bears a fair character among Irish governors.
He did nothing very striking, nor did he contribute
much towards a final pacification; but he was considered a
just man, and he made no personal enemies. He was at least
no bigot, for he received warm praise from Archbishop Browne,
though he did not hesitate to recommend Leverous for a
bishopric. It was, however, decided that St. Leger should
return to Ireland in his stead. Sir Anthony&#8217;s government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
had been cheap, and not ineffectual. During the last five
years of Henry&#8217;s reign there had been a small annual surplus;
but since his death there had been a constantly growing
deficit, which could only be met by increasing the taxation
of the obedient shires, by employing Irish soldiers almost exclusively,
and by maintaining such troops as were necessary
at free quarters upon the country. Miserable expedients certainly;
but the English Government could devise nothing
better, and they were determined to keep down the expenses.
It was resolved not to increase the existing force of 2,024,
and to make no attempt at a thorough conquest. The arrangement
with Tyrone was dishonourable, but was to be adhered
to, lest a breach of faith should lead to war, and consequent
expenditure. The King&#8217;s death prevented a full return to
his father&#8217;s policy, and those who had lately governed in his
name immediately lost all influence.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>Goodacre was consecrated to Armagh and Bale to Ossory
on the same day by Browne, Lancaster of Kildare, and
Eugene Magennis of Down. Where Bale was there was sure
to be controversy, and a fierce one arose about the ritual
proper to the occasion. The Archbishop would have postponed
the ceremony, and Bale, who frequently denounces him
as an epicure, declares that his object was to &#8216;take up the
proxies of any bishopric to his own gluttonous use.&#8217; Lockwood,
Dean of Christ Church, was supreme in his own cathedral,
and his timidity led him to wish for the pontifical order.
Bale accordingly stigmatises him as an ass-headed dean, a
blockhead who cared only for his kitchen and his belly. But
Lockwood had the law on his side; for King Edward&#8217;s first
book only had been proclaimed in Ireland, and it contained
no form for consecration. Browne and Cusack also wished
to stand on the old way. Goodacre was for the form contained
in the second book, and now used in England, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
was willing to waive his own opinion. Bale, however, positively
refused to be consecrated according to the old usage,
boldly maintaining that one king makes one law, and that
Ireland must necessarily follow England. His vehemence
carried the day, and the consecrations took place according
to the new Anglican use. The Communion Service followed,
and Bale rejected the consecrated wafer, successfully arguing
that common bread should be used. He afterwards preached
twelve strong Protestant sermons in Dublin, insisting particularly
on the marriage of priests; and he flattered himself
that he had established the people &#8216;in the doctrines of repentance,
and necessary belief in the gospel.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Goodacre.</div>

<p>Goodacre seems never to have seen his cathedral, to which
access was barred by Shane O&#8217;Neill. Bale says he was a
man of remarkable sincerity and integrity, and a zealous and
eloquent preacher. He also informs us that he was poisoned
by the procurement of certain priests of his diocese, &#8216;for
preaching God&#8217;s verity, and rebuking common vices.&#8217; This
contemporary statement has been doubted, on account of Bale&#8217;s
prejudices, but it is repeated by Burnet on the authority of
Goodacre&#8217;s fourth lineal descendant. Burnet&#8217;s informant received
the story from his grandfather, who was Goodacre&#8217;s
grandson. According to this tradition the actual murderer
was a monk, who pledged Goodacre in poisoned wine, and
died himself of the effects. Bale says he was himself warned
by letter to beware of the Archbishop&#8217;s fate. Whether the
joint authority of Ossory and Sarum is to be rejected or not
will much depend upon the reader&#8217;s opinion of two learned,
and in some respects not dissimilar divines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bale.</div>

<p>Bale soon proceeded to Kilkenny. On his journey from
Waterford to Dublin he had already passed through part of
his diocese, and had been much scandalised by what he saw
and heard. The parish priest of Knocktopher boasted that
he was a son of William, late prior of the Carmelites there&mdash;not
the legitimate son, as he was careful to point out. The
marriage of a friar would have been a heinous offence, but an
irregular connection was venial, and it was thought honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>able
to be the offspring of a spiritual man, whether bishop,
abbot, monk, friar, or secular priest. Bale, who had himself
been a Carmelite, and who had married a wife, rebuked this
candid ecclesiastic, and resolved to set himself as bishop to
the work of reform. He admits that he had no success; and
none could be expected where public opinion sanctioned the
pleasant vices of the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Proceedings
of
Bale.</div>

<p>Far more questionable was Bale&#8217;s zeal against images, the
destruction of which will never make men Protestants. His
opinions were hopelessly at variance with those in vogue in
Ireland, as may be judged from the following autobiographical
passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;Many abominable idolatries maintained by the epicurist
priests, for their wicked bellies&#8217; sake. The Communion or
Supper of the Lord was there altogether used like a popish
mass, with the old apish toys of Antichrist in bowings and
beckings, kneelings and knockings; the Lord&#8217;s death after St.
Paul&#8217;s doctrine neither preached nor yet spoken of. There
wawled they over the dead, with prodigious howlings and
patterings, as though their souls had not been quieted in
Christ and redeemed by His passion; but that they must come
after and help at a pinch with requiem æternam to deliver
them out of hell by their sorrowful sorceries. When I had
beholden these heathenish behavers, I said unto a senator of
that city that I well perceived that Christ had there no bishop,
neither yet the King&#8217;s Majesty of England any faithful officer
of the mayor in suffering so horrible blasphemies.&#8217;</p>

<p>This was at Waterford. At Kilkenny things were no
better, and on his arrival Bale proceeded to show his zeal for
reform. All the statues of saints were turned out of St.
Canice&#8217;s Cathedral, but the Bishop had the good taste to
preserve the fine painted windows erected in the fourteenth
century by his high-handed predecessor Ledred. The less
artistic Cromwellians afterwards destroyed what Bale had
spared, and some fragments were dug up in 1846. Bale had
some supporters, chiefly laymen. The clergy, whose moral
failings he had lashed so mercilessly, were not convinced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
hearing the host called a &#8216;white god of their own making,&#8217;
nor easily persuaded that the lucrative practice of saying
masses for the dead was useless, nor inclined to admit a
liturgy which condemned all that they most valued. The
deanery was in the hands of Bishop Lancaster, who could
give no help, and among the prebendaries there was either
obstructive apathy or violent opposition to change. Bale was
certainly wrong in trying to impose King Edward&#8217;s second
book without legal warrant; but he had gained his point
with Browne, and disdained to yield to the inferior clergy.
The latter pleaded that they had no books, and quoted the
Archbishop against their own diocesan, who says he was
&#8216;always slack in things appertaining to God&#8217;s glory.&#8217; Bale&#8217;s
sincerity is unquestionable, but he had set himself an impossible
task, and his violence made him enemies who showed
no quarter when their turn came. The most patient of men
might have done nothing in such a position, but his reputation
would have been better had he shown some Christian
moderation. Bedell afterwards fell into the hands of his
opponents, but his imprisonment was relieved by expressions
of sympathy and admiration from the most unlikely quarters,
and he must have felt that he had not worked in vain. Bale
could have no such consolation.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Catholic
reaction at
Edward&#8217;s
death.</div>

<p>On the first rumour of Edward&#8217;s death it became evident
that the Bishop of Ossory&#8217;s authority was at an end. Oddly
enough the priests hastened amid general rejoicing to proclaim
Queen Jane. They were eager for change, and probably
knew little of the fair saint whose innocent life was sacrificed
to the ambition of others. Justice Howth, who had been
Bale&#8217;s strongest opponent, censured him for not being present
at the ceremony; &#8216;for indeed,&#8217; says the Bishop, &#8216;I much
doubted that matter.&#8217; In order, he adds, to &#8216;cause the wild
people to bear the more hate to our nation,&#8217; the priests also
propagated a report that the young Earl of Ormonde and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
Barnaby Fitzpatrick had been slain in London. The forts
were attacked, and many Englishmen killed. Mrs. Matthew
King, the clerk of the check&#8217;s wife, was robbed &#8216;to her very
petticoat&#8217; on the highway by the Fitzpatricks and Butlers.
But rumour and uncertainty were soon at an end, and the
priests and people of Kilkenny learned that Catherine of
Arragon&#8217;s daughter was Queen of England.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

entering the holy estate of matrimony, any vows to the contrary notwithstanding.
To modern England a married clergy seems quite natural, but
the scandal was great during the transition period, and Queen Elizabeth
felt the awkwardness herself. The following statement of Harpsfield may
be true or false, but it shows what could be said by a contemporary. It
should be remembered that Harpsfield was Archdeacon of Canterbury.
&#8216;Against these kind of marriages, and maintenance of the same, King
Henry, in his latter days, made very sharp laws, whereupon many so married
put over their women to their servants and other friends, who kept them at
bed and board as their own wives. And after the death of King Henry they
received them again (as love money) with usury; that is, the children in
the mean season begotten by the said friends, whom they took, called and
brought up as their own, as it was well known, as well in other as in
Browne, Archbishop of Dublin. It would now pity a man at the heart to
hear of the naughty and dissolute life of these yoked priests,&#8217; &amp;c.</p></div>

<span class="smaller">THE REIGN OF MARY.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">The succession
to
the crown.</div>

<p>Lawyers and casuists might dispute about the succession.
Logically, Mary and Elizabeth could not both be legitimate;
but the people of England swept these cobwebs away.
Catherine had for twenty-two years borne the title of Queen,
and in that great place she was not known to have done anything
worthy of blame, but much deserving the highest praise.
And then there was the will of Henry VIII. Its execution
had perhaps been informal, but the people cared nothing for
that; it was his will, and he had been authorised by Parliament
to make it. The sick-room fancies of a boy of sixteen
were not to be allowed to alter such a settlement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mary
proclaimed.</div>

<p>The struggle for the crown was short, and was little felt
at the distance at which Ireland then was, though the Dudley
party took care that Queen Jane&#8217;s accession should be officially
known there. On the thirteenth day after her brother&#8217;s death
Mary was proclaimed by the Council in London, on the fourteenth
the baffled Northumberland renewed the proclamation
at Cambridge, on the fifteenth the grand conspirator himself
was arrested. On the very day of the Cambridge proclamation
the Privy Council wrote to Aylmer, the acting Lord Justice
cancelling the former communication, and directing that Mary
should be proclaimed &#8216;Queen of England, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, and on earth supreme head of the
churches of England and Ireland.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Leger is

<p>Besides twelve Privy Councillors, six individuals connected
with Ireland, who happened to be in England, signed these
letters&mdash;Cusack, the Chancellor; Lord Gormanston; Staples,
Bishop of Meath; Thomas Luttrell, Chief Justice of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
Common Pleas; James Bathe, Chief Baron; and the veteran
John Alen. The object probably was to show the men in
Dublin that this time at least there was no mistake as to which
Queen they were to obey. Cusack, Aylmer, Luttrell, and Bathe
were confirmed in their offices with increased emoluments,
and no immediate change was made in the general management
of Irish affairs. Some disturbances amongst the
O&#8217;Connors were easily put down, and the citizens of Dublin
repulsed a raid of the O&#8217;Neills near Dundalk. In the meantime
Northumberland had expiated his crimes on the scaffold.
Gardiner, Bonner, Tunstall, and others had been restored, and
Cranmer, Latimer, and Hooper imprisoned; and there was
time to think of the affairs of Ireland. In October, soon after
the coronation, St. Leger was appointed Lord Deputy in fulfilment
of the late King&#8217;s intention. He landed at Dalkey
on November 11, and on the 19th took the oath and received
the sword in Christ Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His instructions.</div>

<p>St. Leger&#8217;s instructions show the policy which Mary had
adopted. As regards temporal affairs it did not greatly differ
from that of her father. The Scots in Ulster were not to be
molested unless they gave fresh trouble. The army was to be
reduced to 500 regular soldiers, of which not more than ten
per cent. were to be Irishmen. Extraordinary garrisons were
to be discharged at the next general pay day, and if possible
induced to go back to England without raising riots. The
Lord Deputy might employ kerne and gallowglasses where
necessary, and the usual private bands were to be continued;
but coyne and livery were to be eschewed as much as possible.
St. Leger found it impossible to carry out the reduction of
the army lower than 1,100 men, besides kerne. The question
as to the desirability of a Presidency for Munster was to be
carefully considered in all its bearings. Leix and Offaly being
in great measure waste, the Lord Deputy was to grant lands
in fee simple at a small quit-rent either to Englishmen or
Irishmen, binding them to erect and maintain farm buildings,
and to till a certain portion of land. By this means it was
hoped that these unfortunate districts would soon be made like
the English Pale. Leases for twenty-one years were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
given to Crown tenants generally, including holders of monastic
lands. Goodacre had just died, so that there was no
difficulty about Armagh, to which, as well as to the Primacy
of all Ireland, Dowdall was immediately restored, with the
additional grant of the priory of Ards rent free for life. The
Mass and the rest of the old religion was to be restored as
nearly as possible.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mary

<p>But Mary, though zealous for orthodoxy, had no intention
of yielding the rights of the Crown to the Pope, and this was
no doubt well understood. One of St. Leger&#8217;s earliest duties
was to go to Drogheda and place the government of Eastern
Ulster in the hands of Eugene Magennis, who specially
covenanted not to admit any provisor from Rome. An Irish-born
priest named Connor MacCarthy asked Mary for a letter
of licence to go to Rome, there to obtain certain benefices
from the Pope, fearing lest some should be in the Queen&#8217;s
gift, &#8216;and also considering the statute of Premunire.&#8217; Nor
was the fear an idle one, for when Tyrone afterwards obtained
a Papal bull for the appointment of his chaplain to the restored
priory of Down, the Queen sharply reminded him that
she intended to maintain the prerogative in that behalf which
she had received from her progenitors. MacCarthy was not
the only Irish ecclesiastic of the reign who thought it necessary
to petition for relief from the consequences of the dreaded
statute.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

Bale refuses
to give
way.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Bale&#8217;s
religious
dramas.</div>

<p>In some places the old religion was restored without waiting
for any formal order. As soon as Edward&#8217;s death was
known Justice Howth and Lord Mountgarret, the Earl of
Ormonde&#8217;s uncle, went to Kilkenny and desired to have the
sacrament celebrated in honour of St. Anne. The priest said
the Bishop had forbidden celebrations on week days; &#8216;as indeed
I had,&#8217; says Bale, &#8216;for the abominable idolatry that I had seen
therein.&#8217; The learned judge, who seems to have had no commission,
then discharged the clergy from obedience to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
Bishop, and commanded them to proceed in the old way.
On August 20 Mary was proclaimed at Kilkenny with much
solemnity. Bale strongly objected to wear cope or mitre, or
to have the crozier borne before him; not from any opposition
to the Queen&#8217;s title, but from dislike to vain ceremonies.
Taking a New Testament in his hand, he went to the market-cross
followed by a great crowd, to whom he preached from
the 13th chapter of Romans, on the reverence due to magistrates.
But the clergy of the cathedral, who had no sympathy
with the Bishop&#8217;s doctrines, provided two disguised priests to
carry mitre and crozier before him against his will. The
people were amused, instructed, or scandalised, as the case
might be, by the representation of a tragedy concerning God&#8217;s
promises in the old law, and by a comedy of St. John the
Baptist. The baptism and temptation of Christ were brought
upon the stage, and the young men of the town acted both at
the morning and evening performance. Both dramas were
written by Bale himself, and in a literary point of view they
are far from contemptible. They mark the transition between
the mystery plays of the middle ages and the compositions of
Shakespeare&#8217;s immediate precursors. Personified abstractions
as well as historical characters appear on the stage; nor did
Bale shrink from a representation which seems impossible to
us, for he boldly introduces the first person in the Trinity
under the name of Pater Cælestis. Justification by faith is
the great doctrine inculcated, and where the author speaks in
person he loses no opportunity of attacking the Church of
Rome. In an epilogue he exhorts the people to</p>

<div class="poetry-block"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>In his other works Bale throughout shows the same spirit.
Thus he calls that very questionable hero, Sir John Oldcastle,
&#8216;a blessed martyr not canonised by the Pope, but in the precious
blood of his Lord Jesus Christ.&#8217; St. Paul is the great object
of Bale&#8217;s admiration, and he seems to have thought that he
was like him. The points of resemblance are similar to
those which Captain Fluelen discovered between himself and
Alexander the Great. Thus, Paul was tossed up and down
between Candia and Melita, Bale between Milford and Waterford.
There was a river in Monmouth and a river in Macedon,
and there were salmon in both.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition
to Bale in
his diocese.</div>

<p>Sir Richard Howth, Treasurer of St. Canice&#8217;s, and his
friend Sir James Joys, were among Bale&#8217;s most energetic
opponents. To annoy him they suggested solemn exequies
and prayers for the soul of Edward VI. The Bishop argued
that it would be better to wait for orders from Dublin. The
ceremony had already once been postponed to see the devil
dance at Thomastown&mdash;a Sunday amusement which the mob
perhaps preferred to the Bishop&#8217;s plays. Bale found another
enemy in one whom he calls Bishop of Galway, and who was
probably John Moore, Bishop of Enaghdune, the ancient
diocese in which Galway stands. This Moore was commissioned,
along with other prelates not acknowledged in the
Roman succession, to consecrate Patrick Walsh Bishop of
Waterford. He was no credit to the Reformation, for Bale
represents him as spending his nights in drinking and his
days in confirming children at twopence a head. A gallowglass
brought a dog in a sheet with twopence hanging round
his neck to be confirmed with his neighbours&#8217; children; in
this, says Bale, &#8216;noting this beastly Bishop more fit to confirm
dogs than Christian men&#8217;s children.&#8217; The soldier may
have regarded him as a schismatic, but it is not easy to understand
how such a man can have attained episcopal orders.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">He is forced
to fly.</div>

<p>Ten days after the proclamation of Mary there was a
general revolt against Bale, incited by Howth, whose position
in legal circles gave him ample means of knowing how the
wind blew at Court, but who was rather horrified at the length
to which the clergy and their adherents went. In Bale&#8217;s
absence they rang the bells of St. Canice&#8217;s and of all the other
churches, flinging their caps to the battlements of the cathedral
with shouts of laughter, but doing no actual violence. A
little later the mob was not so good-humoured. The Fitzpatrick
and Butler kerne, and especially the &#8216;furious family of
Mountgarret,&#8217; annoyed Bale in many ways. Barnaby Bolger,
an enterprising tradesmen who had formerly aroused great indignation
by forestalling Kilkenny market, and whose young
daughter was married to &#8216;Grace Graceless,&#8217; an adherent of the
Fitzpatricks, headed a tumultuous attack on the Bishop&#8217;s
house outside the town. He and his friend Mr. Cooper, the
parson of Callan, were robbed of all their horses, and thus
deprived of the means of escape. Five of Bale&#8217;s servants, one
of them a girl of sixteen, were caught haymaking, and all
murdered. He managed to close the portcullis and defend
himself until rescued by Robert Shee, the sovereign of Kilkenny,
&#8216;a man sober, wise, and godly, which is a rare thing
in this land.&#8217; Shee, who could command the services of 100
horse and 300 foot, sent Bale by night to Dublin, and no
doubt he thought of St. Paul&#8217;s journey under somewhat
similar circumstances. But there was no safety in the Irish
capital, and the Bishop escaped by sea in a sailor&#8217;s dress. He
was captured at St. Ives and brought before the justices, but
was released when nothing was found to connect him with
Wyatt&#8217;s or any other plot. He was again captured by pirates
and had to pay a ransom, but ultimately succeeded in reaching
Holland. For five years he lived at Basel, where he continued
to write with an acrimony which had not been lessened
by his recent troubles. When Elizabeth became Queen, Bale
made no attempt to regain his bishopric. At sixty-three he
was disinclined to face the Kilkenny people again, or perhaps
he had learned that he was unfit to govern men. He became
a prebendary of Canterbury, and devoted his remaining years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
to literature. His hurried flight from Ireland had forced him
to leave books and manuscripts behind, and the Queen ordered
them to be sent over to him. &#8216;He had,&#8217; she said, &#8216;been
studious in the search of the history and antiquities of this
our realm,&#8217; and might probably do something for their illustration.
Whether Bale ever got back his library or not, he was
certainly not silenced for want of materials; for the extent and
variety of his learning were considered most remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wyatt&#8217;s
rebellion.
Croft,
Cheeke,
and Carew,
1554.</div>

<p>The abortive insurrection of Wyatt had the usual effect of
setting Mary more firmly on the throne, and at the same time
of exasperating her against some whom she might have been
willing to spare. Sir James Croft, the late Lord Deputy, was
arrested before he had time to raise his tenants in Herefordshire:
he was convicted, but afterwards pardoned. Sir Peter
Carew, who afterwards played an important part in Irish
affairs, was also accused of complicity, and thought it prudent
to go abroad, where his companion was no less a personage
than Sir John Cheeke. Venturing to Brussels, where Paget
was ambassador, they were led to suppose that there was no
danger, but that crafty diplomatist had them kidnapped near
Antwerp, and carried to England in a fishing boat. Their
captors were the Flemish and Spanish officials; and Philip,
while expressing becoming indignation at the breach of hospitality,
took care not to hear of it until the prisoners were
safe beyond seas. The passage can hardly have been pleasant,
for they were blindfolded and chained, one at each end of the
boat. Poor Sir John Cheeke, who afterwards showed his unfitness
for the crown of martyrdom, and who perhaps saw a
vision of the stake, did not conceal his misery. &#8216;Although
very well learned, but not acquainted with the cross of troubles,
he was still in great despair, great anguish, and heaviness,
and would not be comforted, so great was his sorrow; but Sir
Peter Carew, whose heart could not be broken nor mind overthrown
with any adversities, and yielding to no such matter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
comforted the other, and encouraged him to be of a good
stomach, persuading him (as though he had been a divine) to
patience and good contentation.&#8217; The man of action, as is
not seldom the case, showed that he had more philosophy
than the philosopher. Sir Peter, whose guilt, if he was guilty,
was much less clear than that of Croft, was pardoned by the
Queen, and afterwards served her well at St. Quentin. Sir
John Cheeke lived to undergo a worse humiliation than that
of Cranmer, to be made an instrument in the persecution of
those with whom he secretly agreed, to suffer in the few
months which his pusillanimity had gained him a thousand
martyrdoms of grief and shame, and then to die heart-broken
and dishonoured. Sir Nicholas Arnold, afterwards employed
by Elizabeth in Ireland, was another of the conspirators.
Lady Jane, the innocent victim of so many intrigues, laid
her beautiful neck upon the block, and fivescore Kentishmen
suffered death for their zeal to the Reformation or their
hatred of Spanish influence. Gerald of Kildare and the
young Earl of Ormonde both served with distinction against
Wyatt, and the orthodox Queen rewarded both with goodly
grants of abbey lands. Ormonde had been captain of one of
the bands of Whitecoats sent by the city into Kent, where
many of his men deserted to the insurgents.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The primacy
is
restored to
Dowdall.</div>

<p>The insurrection being at an end, the Queen lost no time
in forcing Browne to surrender his patent of precedence, and
restoring Dowdall to the primacy, and a commission was
issued to him and to Drs. Walsh and Leverous for re-establishing
the old religion, and punishing those who had violated
the law of clerical celibacy. Browne, who had a wife, was
accordingly deprived, and, pending the appointment of a successor,
the temporalities of his see handed over to Lockwood,
the pliant Dean of Christ Church. Staples of Meath, who
was likewise married, and was besides personally obnoxious to
Dowdall, was also deprived in favour of one of the Commissioners
who sentenced him, the learned William Walsh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
formerly a Cistercian monk of Bective Abbey. Curiously
enough, Walsh, who was appointed by Pole in virtue of his
legatine authority, did not receive a Papal provision till 1564,
some time after Elizabeth had expelled him from his see.
The same treatment for the same offence was inflicted on
Lancaster, Bishop of Kildare, who was succeeded by Leverous,
already Bishop of Leighlin by Papal provision. A fourth
married bishop was Travers of Leighlin, who was succeeded
by Thomas O&#8217;Fihel or Field, an Augustinian friar. A fifth,
Casey of Limerick, had to make way for his aged predecessor
Quin. On Bale, who had left the field clear, no legal sentence
of deprivation was passed; but his successor, John Thonory,
was already appointed. Thonory has an evil name for having
corruptly wasted the property of his see, and is said to have
died of grief at the loss of some of his ill-gotten gains. Of
the deprived prelates, Lancaster lived to be Archbishop of
Armagh, and Casey, who survived two successors, and saw
another expelled, regained his see in 1571. Browne, Travers,
and Lancaster are supposed to have died before the accession
of Elizabeth, and Staples soon after it.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kildare

<p>This year was memorable for the return of Gerald of
Kildare, whose titles and estates were restored to him. The
attainder, however, was not renewed till 1569. Old Brian
O&#8217;Connor was released from the Tower, and allowed to revisit
Offaly, an indulgence which he owed to the exertions of his
daughter Margaret, who was Kildare&#8217;s aunt, and who relied
upon the number of her connections at Court, as well as her
own knowledge of the English language. Barnaby Fitzpatrick,
Lord of Upper Ossory, King Edward&#8217;s bosom friend,
returned about the same time, and so did a far more important
personage, the young Earl of Ormonde. &#8216;There was great
rejoicing,&#8217; say the &#8216;Four Masters,&#8217; &#8216;throughout the greater
part of Leath-Mhogha because of their arrival; for it was
thought that not one of the descendants of the Earls of Kildare,
or of the O&#8217;Connors Faly, would ever come to Ireland.&#8217;</p>

<p>While the obedient shires were busy with the restoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
of the ancient religion, the native Irish made war among
themselves, with but little interference from the Government.
Donough O&#8217;Brien, the second Earl of Thomond, and a firm
friend of the Crown, was killed in April 1553 by his brother
Donnell, leaving the earldom to Connor, his eldest son, by Lady
Helen Butler, who survived him. Donnell, however, assumed
the title of O&#8217;Brien, and the clansmen were divided between
the representatives of the old and new order. Donnell petitioned
that, having been nominated according to the ancient
custom, he might be acknowledged as chief. St. Leger was
unable to grant this, but offered to write to the Queen in his
favour. In the meantime other controversies were submitted
to the arbitration of O&#8217;Carroll, O&#8217;Mulrian, and MacBrien
Arra, on the part of Donnell; and of the barons of Mountgarret,
Cahir, and Dunboyne, all Butlers, on the part of the
Earl. The umpires in case of disagreement were the Lord
Deputy, the Lord Chancellor, and the Earl of Desmond. It
is very hard to make out the exact sequence of events, but
either just before or just after this negotiation, Donnell
attacked one of his nephew&#8217;s castles, and was driven off by
the arrival of the Earl of Ormonde. He then turned his
attention to the plunder of Clanricarde. The Baron of
Delvin continued to ravage MacCoghlan&#8217;s country, and one
of the Nugents, who was foster-brother of Kildare, being
killed, the newly restored Earl, who lost no time in showing
that he meant to keep up the family traditions, exacted
340 cows as an <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">eric</i>. The O&#8217;Carrolls in the south,
the MacSweenys in the north, killed each other in the old
fashion. Shane O&#8217;Neill persuaded the Earl of Kildare and
the Baron of Delvin to take his part in a quarrel with one
sept of his name, and old Tyrone was defeated by another
sept, supported by the MacDonnells, who were also intriguing
with Calvagh O&#8217;Donnell.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pope
and the
&#8216;Rex Hiberniæ,&#8217;

<p>We have seen that the Queen had no intention of yielding
any part of the dignity which had belonged to her predecessors.
Notwithstanding the Papal pretension to suzerainty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
she had as a matter of course assumed the royal title created
by her father in Ireland. The Holy See found it necessary
to respect accomplished facts, and had not Julius III. abandoned
all claims to the monastic lands, Pole would never
have been allowed into England. Paul IV.&#8217;s pretensions were
boundless, but he could not afford to quarrel about a mere
trifle both with England and Spain. He considered it a great
glory for his pontificate that its opening should be signalised
by the arrival of an English ambassador. Whether he wished
it or not, Philip and Mary were, and would remain, King and
Queen of Ireland. He therefore ignored all that Henry had
done, and, as if of his own mere notion, erected Ireland into
a kingdom. The world might perhaps suppose that Mary
took it from his hand, and not in right of blood. &#8216;The Popes,&#8217;
says the sarcastic Venetian, &#8216;have often given that which
they could not take from the possessors, and, to avoid contentions,
some have received their own goods as gifts, and
some have dissembled the knowledge of the gift, or of the
pretence of the giver.&#8217; But in Ireland, where distance cast
a halo of enchantment over Papal politics, and where Franciscans
and Jesuits swayed the popular mind, the bull which
announced the gracious gift was taken by many for what it
pretended to be, and not for what it really was.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen
maintains
her prerogative.</div>

<p>Mary gave evidence of her desire to restore the splendour
of religion by re-establishing St. Patrick&#8217;s as a cathedral.
Leverous was the first Dean of the new foundation, and was
allowed to hold the preferment along with the see of Kildare.
The man selected to undo Browne&#8217;s work was Hugh Curwin,
Dean of Hereford, a native of Westmoreland, and one of the
Queen&#8217;s chaplains. He had become known as a preacher in
favour of Henry&#8217;s marriage with Anne Boleyn, in opposition
to the Franciscan Peto. The deanery of Hereford had been
his reward. Peto, on the other hand, had become the Queen&#8217;s
confessor, and was the chosen instrument of Paul IV., when
that Pope in a fit of anger appointed a legate to supersede<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
Pole. Mary so valued the royal authority that she resented
the irregular honour intended for her confessor, though he
had been the champion of her own legitimacy, stopped the
red hat at the gates of Calais, and never allowed Peto any
benefit from the Pope&#8217;s irritability. On the whole, Anne&#8217;s
advocate fared better than Catherine&#8217;s. Curwin, whose first
article of belief enjoined submission to principalities and
powers, no doubt knew how to turn the Queen&#8217;s love of power,
as he had done her father&#8217;s, to his own advantage. He was
treated with exceptional favour, and gained practical control
of the temporalities even before his consecration, which was
performed in London by Bonner, Thirlby, and Griffin. Immediately
afterwards he received the Great Seal of Ireland.
Curwin had the pall from Rome, and in the Papal record of
his appointment Philip and Mary are said to have supplicated
for it, Browne being ignored, and Curwin made successor to
Alen. But the King and Queen only acknowledged that
Curwin was preferred on their recommendation, and he had
to renounce on oath all things prejudicial to the Crown,
whether contained in the Papal bull or not. Curwin held a
provincial synod soon after his arrival in Ireland, at which
the principal business was the restoration of the ancient rites.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

annalists inexplicably call a crooked gun, he entered Lough
Swilly, took his father prisoner, and battered Greencastle and
another fortress on Lough Foyle. Calvagh thenceforth assumed
practical control of his clan. The Scots slew Hugh
MacNeill Oge, and St. Leger divided his territory between
Phelim O&#8217;Neill and the sons of Phelim Bacagh. The hardy
interlopers had even designs on Carrickfergus, which St. Leger
says were frustrated &#8216;by the help of God and Mr. Parker;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>&#8217;
but in a campaign of six weeks the Lord Deputy could gain
no real advantage. As in the case of most Irish governors,
his detractors, among whom Sir William Fitzwilliam was
conspicuous, were busy at Court. They accused him, among
other things, of falsifying estimates in favour of Andrew
Wyse, the late Vice-Treasurer, whose accounts had been found
unsatisfactory. &#8216;I am now in case,&#8217; he said, &#8216;as the poet&#8217;s
fame. I have meat to the surlip and drink to the netherlip,
and can reach neither of them.&#8217; His position made it impossible
for him to economise, and no money came to pay his
hungry retinue. A friendly chronicler has remarked that St.
Leger, like all other Irish governors, was hated chiefly for
his good deeds; like a good apple tree, which, the more fruit
it bears, the more stones are thrown at it.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>The Lord Deputy&#8217;s entreaties for release were heard at
last, and the government was conferred on Sir Thomas Radcliffe,
Lord Fitzwalter, afterwards created Earl of Sussex, who,
but for his Irish service, would bear one of the fairest characters
in our history. Mary rejoiced that the true Catholic
faith had by God&#8217;s great goodness and special grace been
recovered in England and Ireland, and she directed her representative
&#8216;to set forth the honour and dignity of the Pope&#8217;s
Holiness and See Apostolic of Rome, and from time to time
to be ready with our aid and secular force, at the request of
all spiritual ministers and ordinaries there, to punish and
repress all heretics and Lollards and their damnable sects,
opinions, and errors.&#8217; Cardinal Pole, she added, was about
to send over a legatine commission to visit the Irish Church,
and official assistance was to be given &#8216;in all and everything
belonging to the function and office legatine, for the advancement
of God&#8217;s glory and the honour of the See Apostolic.&#8217;
The new governor was reminded that he lay under an obligation
to execute justice, and was exhorted at much greater
length to exert himself for the improvement of the revenue.
A Parliament was to be held, chiefly as a means of restoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
religion according to the Queen&#8217;s ideas, of settling her marriage
and succession, and of voting a subsidy. Sir Henry
Sidney, who now makes his first appearance in Irish history,
accompanied the Lord Deputy as Vice-Treasurer. He brought
with him a sum of 25,000<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>About the time of the new Lord Deputy&#8217;s arrival, the

140 of the assailants into Powerscourt, where they had to
surrender at discretion. Seventy-four were hanged. John
Challoner, who was Mayor of Dublin at the time, provided
the civic force with arms, which he had brought at his own
expense from Spain. This martial magistrate was offered
knighthood, but he excused himself. &#8216;My Lord,&#8217; he said, &#8216;it
will be more to my credit and my posterity&#8217;s to have it said

<div class="sidenote">Sussex
makes a
journey
into Ulster,
1556.</div>

<p>Sussex landed at Dublin towards the end of May, and
received the sword from St. Leger&#8217;s willing hands. The
religious ceremonies were of a kind entirely satisfactory to
the Queen. After a month&#8217;s stay in the capital he set out
for the North, and appeared in church both at Drogheda and
Dundalk. The force mustered on this occasion was very
considerable, for besides the regular soldiers and Ormonde&#8217;s
followers, the gentlemen of the Pale were called on to serve
with from one to six horsemen each. The Plunkets contributed
twenty-four horse, the Nugents eighteen horse and
twenty-four foot. Dublin sent sixty horsemen and gunners,
and Drogheda forty men well appointed. &#8216;The Byrnes and
the Tooles&#8217; wastes&#8217; in Wicklow were expected to send
twelve horse each, and other Irish contingents joined on
the march. The first Sunday was spent at a mill beyond
Newry, where Dowdall said Mass, and where O&#8217;Hanlon,
whose chiefry seems to have been disputed, was solemnly proclaimed.
Mention is made of a great hill of stones, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
was, perhaps, the traditional spot for the election of an
O&#8217;Hanlon. Passing along the right bank of the Newry river,
which he crossed near Tanderagee, Sussex reached the Laggan
valley near Moira, and passing Belfast, reached Carrickfergus
on the ninth day after leaving Dublin. From this the army
marched across the central districts of Antrim, and, at last,
on the twenty-fourth day from Dublin, Sussex reached
Glenarm, and found that James MacDonnell had fled before
him into Scotland. The fugitive sent to France for help, but
his envoy&#8217;s proceedings were counteracted by Paget&#8217;s vigilance.
A quantity of cattle were captured, besides butter and
other produce hid in a cave. This seems to have been the
only result of an expedition which lasted thirty-seven days.
Sussex dismissed his allies at their old rendezvous near Newry,
and on the very next day, as if in ridicule of his efforts, a
messenger arrived to say that the Scots had attacked the rear
guard. Sidney afterwards said that he had slain James MacConnell,
a mighty Scots captain, during this expedition.
Some Scots of name were certainly killed, and one of them
may have been called James; but the real James MacDonnell
was back at Glenarm before the end of the year.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His failure.</div>

<p>The moral which Sussex drew from this inglorious expedition
was that the North could only be held by a chain of
forts along the coast from Dundalk to Lough Foyle. Some
part at least of the expense would be paid by the salmon
fisheries of the Foyle, the Bann, and the Bush; and by the
herring, cod, ling, and hake fisheries, of which Carlingford was
the chief seat. A good English bishop would also, he thought,
be a means to civilise the country. It had not yet been discovered
that making the Church a badge of conquest only
served to make religion itself odious. The dislike of the
Irish to English ecclesiastics had been marked throughout
the middle ages, and even if England had remained in
communion with Rome, bishops who were Government
officials first and chief pastors afterwards, could scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
have ministered successfully to the wants of O&#8217;Neills and
O&#8217;Donnells.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The King&#8217;s
and
Queen&#8217;s
Counties.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
natives.</div>

<p>The settlement of Leix was in outward form completed,
and Sussex received the Queen&#8217;s thanks for it. The arrangements
were not without a show of equity; but the old inhabitants
could not reconcile themselves to the intrusion of a
colony, and their pertinacious opposition forced the Government
to treat them with far more rigour than had been at
first intended. The western half of the new Queen&#8217;s County
was originally reserved for the O&#8217;Mores, each head of a sept
becoming a landlord holding an estate in tail by knight-service.
The chiefs were prohibited from keeping any idlemen
except of their own sept, or more than one for every 100
acres. They were to attend the constable of the fort when
required, to repair bridges, and at all times to keep the passes
open between their districts and those occupied by the English.
They were to dress like Englishmen, except when
riding, and to teach their children to speak English, to attend
the Deputy annually, and to use only the Common Law. All
above twelve were required to take the oath of allegiance.
Forfeiture was prescribed for a persistent refusal to keep the
passes open; for retaining superfluous idlemen; for keeping
more than one set of harness; for interrupting communication
with the English; for making a private way; for marrying and
fostering with the Irish, and for absenteeism. The Deputy&#8217;s
licence removed the penalty in all these cases. For keeping
unlicensed firearms the first offence was to be punished by
forfeiture, and the second by death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
settlers.</div>

<p>The eastern district was assigned to the English, to hold
on similar terms, and twelve places, among which Stradbally
and Abbeyleix are the best known, were to be kept in a defensible
state as satellites to the royal fort of Maryborough.
The duties of the settlers were in general the same as those
assigned to the O&#8217;Mores; but whereas the latter were
restrained in the matter of arms, the possession of them was
made obligatory on the former. A good bow and sheaf of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
arrows, or one hand-gun at least, was to be kept in every
house. Forfeiture was to be incurred in the same way as by
the Irish, and in addition for falling away from the use of the
English tongue, for holding more than 300 acres in demesne,
or for entertaining Irishmen, except so far as they were
necessary for husbandry. A few natives, whose services as
captains of kerne had deserved special recognition, were to
have grants in the English territory, and it was suggested
that a large territory should be offered to the Earl of Kildare.
A constable, resident at the fort, was to have the same powers
locally as the Lord Deputy had generally. Stringent rules
were made as to free quarters and purveyance. The constable
or president on his annual circuit was to have his own expenses
and those of four men and five horses borne for one
night only by each town; and each sept of the O&#8217;Mores was
to bear the like burden, and no more. Finally, a church was
to be built in each of the twelve settlements within three
years, and a parson, of English birth, was to have the tithe.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The natives

<p>Whatever the intentions of the Queen or her Deputy might
be towards Leix and Offaly, there was sure to be plenty of
opposition on the part of the natives, who were, however, as
usual, divided among themselves. The old chief, Brian
O&#8217;Connor, was still alive, and his son Donough carried on the
old feud and killed his cousin, the son of Cahir Roe. Both
Donough and Connell O&#8217;More, the chief of Leix, fell into the
hands of Sussex in the course of the year, but to the surprise
of the Irish in general were released in deference to Kildare
and Ormonde, who had become in some measure responsible
for them. The O&#8217;Mores remained quiet for a time on the
lands reserved to them. Donough and others of the O&#8217;Connors
afterward came to Sussex at Philipstown, as the fort of Offaly
must henceforth be called, and made their submission,
giving promises of good behaviour, which they immediately
broke.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>After the meeting at Philipstown, Sussex and his Council
repaired to Leighlin, where the principal O&#8217;Connors neglected
to appear as they had promised. A leader of the Kavanaghs,
who had not taken warning by the recent fate of his clansmen,
was executed, and Connel O&#8217;More, who had once more broken
into rebellion, was hanged in chains at Leighlin about the
same time. Offaly was next invaded and hostages taken,

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
of 1557.
The monastic
lands are
not
restored.</div>

<p>The Parliament, from which Mary expected much for the
Church of which she was so faithful a daughter, met at last
and enacted all the laws made in England against the Protestants.
The old statutes against Lollardry, which prescribed
death by fire as the punishment for obstinate or relapsed
heretics, were declared to be in full force. A communication
from Pole was read by Curwin as Chancellor, kneeling down
in open session, in which the Cardinal urged the assembly to
restore Ireland to full communion with the Church. All
Acts derogatory to the Pope which had been passed since
the twentieth year of Henry VIII. were accordingly repealed.
The Queen was declared a legitimate, absolute sovereign, and
all laws and sentences to the contrary were abrogated. On
the other hand, grants of monastic land were confirmed.
There could be no doubt of Mary&#8217;s wish to restore the religious
houses, but this does not appear to have been done except in
the single case of Kilmainham. Oswald Massingberd, who
during the Puritan ascendency had led a wandering life in
the woods, was appointed Prior by Pole, and the nomination
was confirmed by the Queen. Massingberd was sworn of the
Council, and assumed the position of his predecessors; but
he seems to have had no belief in the stability of the new
system. He gave long leases and sold all that was saleable,
and he took no thought for the morrow. There appears to
have been no intention of specially favouring the obsolete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
order of St. John, for no attempt was made to restore it in
England; but in Ireland it happened that the Crown had not
parted with the house and lands. In the same way, since it
could be done without offending vested interests, Mary re-established
the Benedictines at Westminster, the Carthusians
at Sheen, and the Observants at Greenwich. There are indications
that she wished to examine titles closely, and to restore
the monks where defects appeared; but she granted and
confirmed grants of abbey lands as freely as her father and
brother. Ninety years later, when the confederate Catholics
had military possession of the greater part of Ireland, and the
Nuncio Rinuccini was apparently all-powerful, the claim of
the regulars to their old possessions was met by the nobility
and gentry with anger and scorn.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sussex
makes an
abortive
expedition
westward;</div>

<p>When released from his Parliamentary duties, Sussex
marched westward against the O&#8217;Connors, who, under
Donough, had possessed themselves of Meelick Castle, on the
Shannon. The line of march lay through Offaly, by Killeigh,
Ballyboy, and Cloghan, no opposition being offered by the
O&#8217;Molloys or O&#8217;Maddens. The Shannon was reached on the
third day. Clanricarde must have been in a tolerably peaceful
state, for Athlone pursuivant seems to have had no difficulty
in going to Galway to seek ammunition and provisions.
Cannon were brought by water from Athlone and planted in
the grounds of the friary, on an island or peninsula on the
Galway side of the stream. The castle was summoned, and a
cautionary shot fired without effect. Next day the cannonade
began, and at the sixteenth shot a large piece of the
courtyard wall fell down. The O&#8217;Connors escaped by a
postern gate, and were proclaimed traitors. Clanricarde,
Thomond, O&#8217;Carroll, and other chiefs, came to pay their respects
to Sussex, and may well have laughed at the small
results achieved by the display of irresistible force. A garri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>son
was placed in the castle, and, hostages having been taken
from the neighbouring clans, the army returned through MacCoghlan&#8217;s
country, led by the chief himself. The Lord Deputy
had the pleasure of seeing the night lit up by fires which the
rebels kindled within a mile of his camp. The outlying
buildings at Philipstown were all burnt, and arrows shot into
the fort itself. Such was the practical outcome of a nine
days&#8217; expedition, during which, as the annalists say, it is not
easy to state or enumerate all that was destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">and

<p>An expedition into Ulster, undertaken three months later,
had the same lame and impotent conclusion. The annalists
say compendiously that Armagh was burned twice in one
month by Thomas Sussex. His horsemen encamped in the
cathedral, and no enemy opposed the destroyer, who returned
after a week to Dundalk only to hear that Shane O&#8217;Neill
was burning and plundering within four miles of the town.
Being pursued, Shane retreated to his woods, whither those
who knew the country declined to follow him. Sussex then
returned to Dublin; the Queen being richer by a few cows,
and Sir James Garland poorer by the village which O&#8217;Neill
had burned.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The

<p>Not much impressed by the late invasion, the O&#8217;Connors
who had escaped from Meelick stationed themselves at Leap
Castle, about which there had been so much fighting in
bygone days. Sussex took the castle without trouble, but
Donough again escaped by the speed of his horse, and the
stronghold was seized by O&#8217;Carroll as soon as the army had
left. Sidney afterwards made two separate inroads into the
same district. O&#8217;Molloy was proclaimed a traitor, and everything
destroyed. It is not easy to see how there could be
anything combustible left in the devoted country. The
O&#8217;Carrolls were also engaged about this time in opposition
to the Government, and in support of the O&#8217;Mores and
O&#8217;Connors, and the annalists are again at a loss to enumerate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">War
between the
O&#8217;Neills
and
O&#8217;Donnells.</div>

<p>A local war of considerable importance took place this
year between the O&#8217;Neills and O&#8217;Donnells. Manus, the old
chief of Tyrconnel, had been kept a prisoner for the last two
years by his son Calvagh, who assumed the leadership. This
claim was disputed by his brother Hugh, who, with his immediate
adherents, had deserted to Shane O&#8217;Neill. Shane
was delighted at the opportunity of interfering, and declared
that not one cow should escape, though the O&#8217;Donnells should
carry away their cattle into Leinster or Munster. He himself
would in future be the sole King of Ulster. Shane
pitched his camp at Carriglea, near Strabane, just above the
junction of the Finn and the Mourne. It was more a fair
than an encampment, and the time was gaily passed in buying,
and no doubt in drinking wine and mead, as well as fine
clothes and merchandise. Calvagh, who lay five miles off
with a few followers, sent two trusty spies to the camp, who
mingled boldly with the throng of camp followers and soldiers
belonging to many different clans. In front of Shane&#8217;s tent
they found a great central fire, and a huge torch as thick as
a man&#8217;s body blazing brightly. Sixty gallowglasses with
their axes, and as many Scots, with heavy broadswords drawn,
stood ready to guard the chief. When the time came for
serving out supper, the spies claimed their share with the
rest, and received a helmet full of meal and a corresponding
quantity of butter. Not staying to make cakes, they carried
back the trophy to Calvagh, who immediately got his men
under arms. He had but two companies of the MacSweeney
gallowglasses and thirty horsemen. No look-out was apparently
kept at the camp, which they entered at once. There
they had little to do but to kill till their arms were tired, the
deficiency of force being much more than counterbalanced by
the totally unprepared state of the O&#8217;Neills. Shane, whose
reputation for courage is not high, slipped out at the back of
his tent with only two companions, leaving his men to their
fate. The three fugitives threaded the passes of the neigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>bouring
mountains, and passed the Finn, the Deel, and the
Derg by swimming. At Termonamongan, near the latter
river, Shane bought a horse, and never rested till he reached
the neighbourhood of Clogher. Calvagh remained in possession
of the camp, and his men spent the rest of the night in
drinking the wine which the O&#8217;Neills had provided for themselves.
The extent of the plunder may be estimated from
the fact that Con, Calvagh&#8217;s young son, who had given up
his horse to his father and fought on foot, now had eighty
steeds for his share, including a celebrated charger of Shane&#8217;s
called the Eagle&#8217;s Son.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidney,
Lord-Justice.
No money.</div>

<p>Sussex had not been very long in Ireland before he asked
for a holiday, and he was allowed to spend Christmas at
home; Curwin and Sidney, and afterwards Sidney only,
being appointed Lords Justices. War had been declared with
France at midsummer, and one of the first letters received
by the new governor announced the loss of Calais, and the
Queen&#8217;s vain hope of recovering it. In the storm of St.
Quentin and the defence of Guisnes, English soldiers had
shown that they were made of the same stuff as the victors of
Agincourt, but the war was unpopular. Mary&#8217;s subjects felt
that they were sacrificed to Philip, and this jealousy of Spain
both caused the fall of Calais and prevented its recovery.
But the national vanity was sorely hurt, and Sidney thought
it a good opportunity to point out that James MacDonnell
was expected in Ulster with many French and Scots allies,
and that the natives would join him or fall upon the Pale,
which was itself heartily sick of English rule, of soldiers at
free quarters, and of purveyors, who paid, if they paid at all,
something very much less than market prices. The army
was reduced to a little over 1,000 men, and the people of the
Pale, though well disposed, could afford no effective help.
Credit was extinct, and the bad money caused great misery.
Yet even bad coin was scarce. &#8216;Help us, my lord,&#8217; he wrote
openly to Sussex, &#8216;help us to money at this pinch, though
it be as base as counters.&#8217;</p>

<p>Men, money, and provisions were alike wanting, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
outlook was as dark as could be. Desmond proposed that
the Queen should send special commissioners, independent
of the Government, to inquire into the state of Ireland, and
point out means of reformation. He himself had perhaps
sinned through ignorance, and he thought justice and fair
dealing more likely to do the work of civilisation than a new
conquest. &#8216;We neither think it meet, nor intend,&#8217; answered
Mary, with a touch of her father&#8217;s humour, &#8216;to make any
new conquest of our own, nor to use any force when justice
may be showed.&#8217; She proposed to do all that was necessary
by fair means.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Hatred of
the English
Government.</div>

<p>Sidney&#8217;s fears of foreign complications were not unfounded.
He had no ship of war at his disposal, and he feared that
Dublin might be blockaded. George Paris was in France,
declaring that the wild Irish were quite ready to transfer
their allegiance, and Sidney had reason to believe that Kildare
was playing his hereditary game. There can be no
doubt that this great nobleman, whose estates lay between
the capital and the disturbed midland districts, was a thorn
in the side of each successive governor. It was thought he
wanted to be Deputy himself, and all the principal lawyers
in Dublin had a retaining fee from him. William Piers,
Constable of Carrickfergus, the vigilant guardian of the
North, was told by one of his men who was present, that
Sorley Boy MacDonnell, in the careless after-supper hour, said
plainly &#8216;that Englishmen had no right to Ireland, and they
would never trust Englishmen more, but would trust the Earl
of Kildare, &#8220;who,&#8221; quoth Sorley, &#8220;hath more right to the
country....&#8221; The nature of these people is they will speak
what is in their hearts when the drink is in their heads.&#8217;
The love of claret, inherent both in Scottish and Irish chiefs,
tended to keep up constant communication with France.
The hereditary hatred of England might at any moment
counterbalance the jealousy which Scotland felt for the French
regent and king matrimonial, and an invasion of Ireland might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
seem less dangerous than that from which the caution of the
Scots lords had just saved England. The recollection of
Dundalk was not so fresh as that of Flodden.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>Lady Tyrone had been closely imprisoned, apparently by
Shane, for urging her husband to hold fast to his allegiance.
&#8216;I will not,&#8217; says Sidney&#8217;s informant, &#8216;you make this known
to the Primate, or Kildare, or any Geraldine in Ireland.&#8217; To
the Queen the Lord Justice wrote that the coast was infested
by hostile cruisers, that he dreaded a French attack on castles
which could not resist artillery, and that he could scarcely
be answerable for the defence of the country. The effect of
Sussex&#8217;s advice while at Court may be gathered from the number
of letters which Mary addressed to great men in Ireland.
Tyrone and O&#8217;Reilly were thanked for past services, the
former being charged to help the Deputy with a contingent,
and the latter to dismiss the Scots in his pay. Calvagh
O&#8217;Donnell was reminded of his duty, and encouraged to hope
for a peerage and other rewards. Barnaby Fitzpatrick, whose
courtly education was not forgotten by his friend&#8217;s sister, was
exhorted to behave like one who regards the service and weal
of his natural country. His neighbour O&#8217;Carroll might
look forward to a peerage for life if he would give help in
season. Desmond and Clanricarde were directed to put
Thomond in possession of his earldom and estates, the care
of the coast being particularly recommended to the former.
Desmond and Ormonde were thanked, and advised to refer
all their differences to the arbitration of the Lord Deputy and
Council.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A spirited
policy.</div>

<p>The Queen did not limit her care for Ireland to writing
letters. She doubled the army; 800 men being sent over,
and directions given for raising 200 more in Ireland. Every
foot soldier was to receive twopence a day, and every horseman
threepence a day, in addition to the old wages. The Deputy&#8217;s
salary was raised from 1,000<i>l.</i> to 1,500<i>l.</i>, with the usual
allowances, and he was directed to move constantly to and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
fro, residences being maintained for him at Roscommon,
Athlone, Monasterevan, Maryborough, Philipstown, Ferns,
Enniscorthy, and Carlow. The O&#8217;Mores and O&#8217;Connors were
to be still further chastised, and as much as possible effected
against the Scots. In most other matters the former instructions
were to remain in force. The restored Deputy was not
expected to make bricks without straw, more than 200<i>l.</i> having
been spent on the carriage of munitions to Chester for
the Irish service.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sussex
returns to
Ireland,
1558.</div>

<p>Sussex left London on March 21, and we are told that he
travelled post; but he did not leave Holyhead till the 26th
of the following month. The actual passage only occupied
a few hours. Detraction, the usual lot of Irish governors,
followed him on his journey, his accuser being no less a person
than Primate Dowdall, who was summoned over to tell
his own story, and who died in London some three months
before the Queen. Sidney and his Council declared that the
Archbishop was actuated by personal malice, and that there
was no foundation for his statements. There was, however,
some excuse for a prelate who saw his metropolis and three
churches burned by the viceregal army. Sussex believed
that Dowdall was in league with his predecessor. Were it
not, he said, for his set purpose to serve the Queen, he might
find occupation enough in avoiding the nets spread on all
sides, the catch line whereof he could not prove but by looking
into Mr. St. Leger&#8217;s bosom.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
O&#8217;Connors
still
troublesome.
Sussex
goes to
Munster.</div>

<p>Sussex had left Leix and Offaly in confusion, and he returned
to find them in the same state, his brother, Sir Henry
Radecliffe, being actually besieged in Maryborough by the
natives, under Donogh and another O&#8217;Connor, accompanied
by Richard Oge, one of the bastard Geraldines who had so
long been troublesome. The garrison beat off their assailants
after a hard fight, Richard Oge falling by the hand of Francis
Cosby; but Donough again escaped. The first matter which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
demanded the personal attention of Sussex after his return
was the state of Thomond, where Sir Donnell More O&#8217;Brien&mdash;who
had slain his brother, the second Earl, five years
before&mdash;was now disputing the title of his young nephew
Connor, whose principal castles he held. Ormonde, whose
aunt was the young lord&#8217;s mother, was of course interested
in his favour, and the same reason was enough to make
Desmond incline to Sir Donnell. It became necessary for
Sussex himself to go in force and establish some kind of
order. Taking the familiar line through Offaly and Ely,
Leap Castle being abandoned at their approach, the Lord
Deputy and his troops, strengthened on the route by the
adhesion of Barnaby Fitzpatrick and a considerable force,
marched across North Tipperary by Newport and Cahirconlish
to Limerick, which was reached on the seventh day after
leaving Dublin. At a point a few miles from the city Ormonde
and his brother Edmund appeared with a large party.
The young lord of Cahir, Gerald the heir of Desmond,
with all the forces of his house, MacCarthy More, who
received the honour of knighthood and a gold chain and
gilded spurs, and William Burke, chief of the district, joined
on the same day. At the gate of Limerick the mayor and
aldermen in scarlet robes delivered to Sussex the keys and
mace, which he returned to the mayor. With the civic insignia
and sword of state borne before him, the Lord Deputy
rode to the door of the cathedral, where the Marian bishop,
Hugh Lacy, met him, and where he was censed and sprinkled
with holy water. Sussex kissed the cross both here and at
the rood, where the same ceremonies were repeated, and
knelt devoutly at the high altar while the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> was
sung. Salutes were fired after church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Desmonds
at
Limerick.</div>

<p>The Lord Deputy rested ten days at Limerick, during
which time was performed the rite of &#8216;bishoping&#8217; Desmond&#8217;s
youngest child, the old Earl being present himself. This was
a first or second baptism, for the little Fitzgerald was not old
enough to be confirmed, and the Lord Deputy stood sponsor
and gave his god-child his own name, and presented him at
the same time with a gold chain. The career of James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
Sussex Fitzgerald thus auspiciously begun was destined to
end in a traitor&#8217;s death on the scaffold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
O&#8217;Briens.</div>

<p>Sir Donnell O&#8217;Brien failed to appear, and was thrice proclaimed
traitor at Limerick. Sussex then issued forth into
Thomond. Clare Castle and Ennis made no resistance, but
a few cannon shot had to be fired at Bunratty before it surrendered.
The Earl of Thomond, having been placed in possession
of his country, was sworn upon the sacraments and
on the relics of the Church with bell, book, and candle, to
forsake the name of O&#8217;Brien, and to be true to the King and
Queen. All the freeholders of the district swore in the same
solemn way to obey him as their captain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">O&#8217;Shaughnessy.</div>

<p>On his journey westward from Limerick, Sussex spent a
night with O&#8217;Shaughnessy at Gort, where he &#8216;dined so worshipfully
as divers wondered at it, for the like was not seen
in an Irishman&#8217;s house.&#8217; At Galway he was received with the
same civic, military, and religious ceremonies as at Limerick,
and, after staying four or five days, returned by Athenry and
Meelick into Offaly, and thence to Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Expedition
against the
Hebridean
Scots.
It ends in
failure.</div>

<p>Sidney&#8217;s apprehensions were partially realised, for James
MacDonnell landed before Sussex with 600 islemen and two
guns. But Carrickfergus had been reinforced, and the greater
part of the Scots returned to their own country. Colla MacDonnell,
one of the chief&#8217;s five brothers and the resident
guardian of his clan&#8217;s Irish interests, died soon afterwards,
and, his brother Angus having refused to take his place,
Sorley Boy, the youngest and ablest of the family, filled the
vacant post. It was decided to attack the Redshanks in their
own islands, and a fleet assembled at Lambay from which
great things were evidently expected. Sussex urged despatch;
but the delays of the supply service were inveterate, and
nothing was done for nearly three weeks. The Lord Deputy
landed first in Cantire, and began operations by burning James
MacDonnell&#8217;s &#8216;chief house called Sandell, a fair pile and a
strong.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fleet
is in
danger,</div>

<p>He boasted that in three days he burned everything from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
sea to sea in a district twenty miles long, and this without
meeting any opposition worth notice. Isla was the great
object of the expedition; but the wind was unfavourable, and
the incendiary&#8217;s work could be carried on elsewhere. Arran
was accordingly devastated, the army dividing into two, so as to
make the damage more complete. Isla being still inaccessible,
the same fate was intended for Bute, but just as the boats
were about to be manned a sudden gale sprung up, &#8216;and that
being then the weather shore the wind wheeled suddenly and
made it the lee shore, whereby we being very near the shore
were forced to ride it out for life and death in such a place as
if any tackle had slipped or broken the ship whose tackle had
so slipped or broken must needs have perished.&#8217; The cable
of a Dublin transport parted, and she foundered with a loss
of twenty-eight men. Most of the small vessels got into
harbour, &#8216;but the masters of H.M.&#8217;s ships I think thought
scorn thereof.&#8217; The fine gentlemen who commanded men-of-war
in those days were unwilling to take advice from the old
seamen who acted as their sailing masters or pilots. With loss
of boats, running rigging, and anchors, the fleet escaped, and
the captains, whose courage was &#8216;somewhat cooled,&#8217; were content
after this to be controlled by their professional associates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and is
forced to
retire.</div>

<p>The poor little Cumbrays having been ravaged, the disabled
vessels were just able to reach Carrickfergus after a
dead beat against a stiff north-wester. Sussex landed, and was
nearly lost in regaining his flag-ship, the &#8216;Mary Willoughby.&#8217;
A council of war was then held, and it was found that there
were provisions for only three weeks more, and that damages
could not be properly repaired in Ireland. Only three ships
were at all fit for service; and, moreover, &#8216;the new bark is a
ship of such length and unwieldliness in steerage as she is not
to be ventured among the isles in such stormy weather, where
there be many deep and narrow channels and strong tides.&#8217;
It was feared that the ships might be becalmed or otherwise
delayed in the isles, there was now no spare tackle in case of
future storms, and it was by no means impossible that the
crews and troops might starve. The hope of visiting Isla was
therefore abandoned, and Sussex landed the soldiers with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
less ambitious intention of attacking the Scots in the Route.
An English fleet and army carefully equipped and commanded
by many gallant gentlemen had just succeeded in burning
some barren islands, not without considerable loss to themselves,
and had returned disabled without striking a blow.
Sussex was conscious of his failure, and begged the Queen
&#8216;not to impute any lack in me, but to consider that whatever
I wrote of was feasible, is feasible, and shall with grace of
God be put in execution with a great deal more than I wrote
of,&#8217; &amp;c. The expedition is not even noticed in the Scots correspondence
of the time, nor was anything done to retrieve
matters on land. Out of 1,100 soldiers, but 400 were fit for
service, the rest being prostrated by illness caused by the foul
water on board ship.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Activity of
Sussex.
He leaves
Ireland at
Mary&#8217;s
death.</div>

<p>Want of activity at least could not be charged against
Sussex, who carried out strictly the spirit of the Queen&#8217;s instructions,
which desired him to be constantly on the move.
He was at Leighlin a few days after his return from Scotland,
and then returned to Dublin, where the affairs of Munster
occupied his attention. The old Earl of Desmond was dead,
and his son Gerald, destined to a disturbed life and a miserable
death, succeeded to the splendid but troublesome inheritance
of the Southern Geraldines. He promised fair, and was
knighted by the Lord Deputy&#8217;s hands, who went to Waterford
to receive his homage and to admit him to the earldom. Sir
Maurice Fitzgerald of Decies, who ruled about one half of the
county of Waterford, also made his submission, promising to
obey the law and make others obey it, to give his help to all
judges, commissioners, and tax-gatherers, and to secure free
admission for all to the markets at Waterford, Dungarvan, and
elsewhere. The news of Mary&#8217;s death reached Ireland soon
after this, and Sussex, who had already obtained leave to go
to England, hurried away to pay his court to the new sovereign.
He left Ireland tolerably quiet.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Story as to
an intended
Marian
persecution
in Ireland.</div>

<p>Mary did all she could to efface her father&#8217;s anti-Roman
policy; but no Irish persecution took place. This may have
been less from the Queen&#8217;s want of will than from the insignificance
of the Protestants in Ireland. It is said that many
people fled from the western parts of England in hope of
sharing the comparative immunity enjoyed by the small
Protestant congregation in Dublin. One story seems to show
that this had attracted attention, and that Dublin would not
have long escaped. It rests on the testimony of Henry Usher,
one of the fathers of Trinity College and afterwards Archbishop
of Armagh, and was repeated by his more famous nephew
James Usher, and by other public men of repute. Henry
Usher died at a great age in 1613, and was Treasurer of St.
Patrick&#8217;s as early as 1573. In the absence of anything to
rebut it, such evidence can hardly be rejected. The story is
that a Protestant citizen of Dublin named John Edmonds had
a sister living at Chester married to one Mattershed, who
kept an inn or lodging-house in which Cole, Dean of St. Paul&#8217;s,
slept when on his way to purge the Irish Church. &#8216;Here,&#8217;
said Cole, in the hearing of his hostess, &#8216;is a commission that
shall lash the heretics of Ireland.&#8217; The good woman watched
her opportunity, possessed herself of the doctor&#8217;s wallet, and
substituted a pack of cards for the commission&mdash;a service for
which she received a pension of 40<i>l.</i> from Queen Elizabeth.
On reaching Dublin, Cole went straight to the Castle, where
the Lord Deputy, who had just returned from his Scotch expedition,
was sitting in council. Cole declared his business
in a set speech; but when the secretary opened his wallet he
found only the cards, with the knave of clubs uppermost.
Sussex had conformed to the dominant creed, but had probably
no wish to be a persecutor, and may have rejoiced at Cole&#8217;s
discomfiture. &#8216;Let us have another commission,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;and we will shuffle the cards in the meanwhile.&#8217; A new
scourge for the heretics was despatched, but before it came to
hand Mary&#8217;s unhappy career had closed.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>The weak enthusiast who, far more than Gardiner or

long divided from her in death. Reginald Pole survived his
kinswoman some twenty-two hours, and almost the last sounds
